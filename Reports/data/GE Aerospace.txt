GE Aerospace - Climate Change 2023
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Throughout our more than 130-year history, GE has held a larger purpose of innovating technology to lift the quality of life for people around the globe—a core driver of sustainability. Sustainability priorities are woven into all that we do, including our business strategy, policies, leadership engagement, operating mechanisms, commitments and, ultimately, our products. From ensuring more people have access to more sustainable, reliable and affordable energy, to helping people thrive by staying connected to family, friends and economic opportunities, we are committed to making a substantial impact on people and the planet for the better.



In November 2021, we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from (i) our Aerospace business, (ii) our Renewable Energy, Power, Digital and Energy Financial Services businesses, which we plan to combine and refer to as GE Vernova, and (iii) our former HealthCare business. By sharpening our focus on the specific missions of each business, we gain more opportunity for GE Vernova to electrify and decarbonize the world, for GE Aerospace to invent the future of flight and for the newly independent GE HealthCare to create a world where healthcare has no limits. Our mission to succeed in driving decarbonization through the energy transition and creating a smarter and more efficient future of flight is governed by core sustainability priorities built first and foremost on GE’s unique culture of integrity in everything we do. As the world changes, we continuously adapt and improve our programs to ensure we succeed in these priorities. 



We serve customers in approximately 170 countries. Manufacturing and service operations are carried out at 75 manufacturing plants located in 26 states in the United States and Puerto Rico and at 130 manufacturing plants located in 32 other countries. The scope of this report is GE enterprise as a whole, referred as “GE”, “we”, or “the Company”, and may include examples from individual business segments but is not necessarily a complete superset of all activities undertaken across the Company.

C1. Governance
C1.1
(C1.1) Is there board-level oversight of climate-related issues within your organization?
Yes
C1.1a
(C1.1a) Identify the position(s) (do not include any names) of the individual(s) on the board with responsibility for climate-related issues.
Position of individual or committee	Responsibilities for climate-related issues
Director on board
The full GE Board is responsible for overseeing climate-related issues, particularly as they relate to strategy and risk for GE’s businesses, and the Board regularly discusses strategic considerations related to climate change and the energy transition.
The Board recognizes that the long-term interests of the Company require responsibly addressing the concerns of stakeholders beyond just shareholders, including employees, recruits, customers, supplier's communities, government officials and the public at large.

The Board oversees the execution of GE’s sustainability priorities and initiatives as an integrated part of the Company’s overall strategy and risk management. Matters related to sustainability often span multiple functional categories and areas of oversight, and therefore involve discussion at the full Board level as well as individual committees.

In that regard, relevant focus areas for the full Board in 2022 included: Strategy for the energy transition; GE’s ambitions, goals and reporting related to greenhouse gas emission reductions from customers’ use of sold products; Primary risks and opportunities across GE’s businesses, including risks related to climate change and other sustainability matters.
Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
The Company's Chief Executive Officer is responsible to the Company's Board of Directors for risks related to the Company's strategic planning and priorities, including overseeing climate-related issues, particularly as they relate to strategy and risk for GE’s businesses, and the Board regularly discusses strategic considerations related to climate change and the energy transition.

Sustainability is integrated with strategy development and risk management across the company. GE’s sustainability lens is used to focus on operations and priorities within each business, and cross-functional committees and teams at the leadership level align strategic priorities and culture.

At the corporate level, the Corporate Risk Working Group—a small group of key functional leaders, as well as the Chief Risk Officer—meets quarterly to assess enterprise- wide risks as well. The Audit Committee oversees GE’s enterprise risk management framework and receives a quarterly enterprise risk report from the Chief Risk Officer. GE business leaders also periodically review their risk management programs and top risks with the Audit Committee, and it is the business CEOs—rather than a compliance or legal professional—who lead discussions with the Audit Committee to provide strong business accountability for risk management. In addition, each business CEO meets regularly with the Board to review their strategies and operations. Our Governance Principles and committee charters define the risk areas for which each committee has ongoing oversight responsibility, while the Board, as a whole, focuses on the most significant risks facing the company.

We periodically review a range of actual and projected metrics in assessing these types of risks and opportunities, including new unit equipment sales, power generation by asset type, levelized cost of energy, levelized cost of storage, fuel prices (including natural gas and hydrogen), pricing for mandatory and voluntary carbon offsets or credits, and internal and external modeling. Our consideration of top climate-related risks and opportunities also feeds into our annual long-term strategy review process, during which our businesses evaluate a handful of key questions related to their long-term strategies.

We seek to continuously improve our processes to identify, assess and respond to these types of climate-related opportunities and risks, as this remains central to the strategy for our businesses.
Board-level committee
The Board's Governance & Public Affairs Committee also plays an important role in GE’s sustainability oversight, and has primary oversight of GE’s priorities and external reporting related to sustainability/ESG matters, as well as policies and strategies related to political spending and lobbying, human rights, and environment, health and safety.

Relevant focus areas for the Governance & Public Affairs Committee in 2022 included regular updates on safety programs and performance throughout GE; Climate policy engagement via public policy advocacy and lobbying related to climate change and the energy transition; sustainability programs and performance, and the transition of programs and reporting to each of the three planned independent public companies.
Board-level committee
The Audit Committee also has a role in sustainability matters to the extent these topics relate to financial reporting and regulatory requirements, including reporting on these matters in SEC filings and data quality related to this reporting. The Audit Committee has oversight over: Regulatory, compliance and litigation risks; Financial reporting, systems and internal controls; Cybersecurity; Enterprise risk management framework; and in coordination with the Governance Committee, oversight of external reporting related to sustainability matters and data quality related to this reporting.
Chief Risk Officer (CRO)
Sustainability is integrated with strategy development and risk management across the company. GE’s sustainability lens is used to focus on operations and priorities within each business, and cross-functional committees and teams at the leadership level align strategic priorities and culture.
At the corporate level, the Corporate Risk Working Group—a small group of key functional leaders, as well as the Chief Risk Officer—meets quarterly to assess enterprise- wide risks as well.

Our consideration of top climate-related risks and opportunities also feeds into our annual long-term strategy review process, during which our businesses evaluate a handful of key questions related to their long-term strategies.
We seek to continuously improve our processes to identify, assess and respond to these types of climate-related opportunities and risks, as this remains central to the strategy for our businesses.
Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)
GE’s Chief Sustainability Officer coordinates efforts by our business leaders, engineers, and strategic thinkers to ensure we improve our impacts to our communities, people and planet in measurable and meaningful ways. The CSO occasionally updates the Board on progress toward GE’s climate related commitments and net zero ambitions. The CSO also supports efforts for GE’s technology and innovation to address climate-related challenges.

The CSO helps GE accelerate outcomes by promoting closer collaboration between GE’s leaders and governments, policy makers, NGOs, and our investors, communities, and peers. The CSO also coordinates efforts to operationalize GE’s sustainability efforts by approaching sustainability with the same high expectations of rigor and accountability that we use to run our businesses, using lean principles to continuously improve toward our goals.

GE’s Board seeks to operate with the highest degree of effectiveness, supporting a dynamic boardroom culture of independent thought and intelligent debate on critical matters.
The full Board has oversight over:Strategy for the energy transition and climate change, including climate-related risks and opportunities; GE’s ambition and goals related to greenhouse gas emission reductions; Sustainability, including external reporting; Health and safety of employees and communities; Enterprise risk management; Developments in ESG reporting and analysis.
There are two Board Committees with oversight of climate related issues. The Audit Committee has oversight over: Regulatory, compliance and litigation risks; Financial reporting, systems and internal controls; Cybersecurity; Enterprise risk management framework; and in coordination with the Governance Committee, oversight of external reporting related to sustainability matters and data quality related to this reporting. The Governance and Public Affairs Committee has oversight over: Priorities and external reporting related to sustainability matters; Corporate governance; Public policy and government relations activities, including political spending and lobbying activities;Environmental, health and safety matters; Human rights; Support of full Board’s oversight on climate change.
Each Board committee meets periodically throughout the year, reports its actions to the Board, receives reports from senior management, annually evaluates its performance and can retain outside advisors. Formal meetings are typically supplemented with additional calls and sessions.
The energy transition and climate-related issues have been significant areas of focus at the Board level. During 2022 the full Board discussed climate-related matters at three regulatory-scheduled meetings, and the Governance Committee discussed climate-related matters at three regularly scheduled meetings, in each case, including climate-change related risks and opportunities across GE’s businesses. The Board is actively engaged with GE leadership on related topics such as the competitive landscape for our businesses amidst climate-related shifts in technology, product and service demand; analysis of potential pathways for decarbonization; customer, shareholder and other stakeholder expectations; the Company’s decarbonization strategy; and reducing the environmental impact of GE’s own operations and customers’ use of our sold products. For example, the Board discussed and helped shape decisions such as setting a goal for GE to become carbon neutral by 2030 in our own operations, our ambition to be net zero in 2050 including emissions from sold products and the exit from the new-build coal business, as well as our Scope 3 reporting. This focus is also reflected in the Board’s Governance Principles and committee charters, which the Board revised to more expressly highlight its role in the oversight of sustainability and climate change-related matters.

In 2021, GE made a further organizational commitment to elevate its broader sustainability strategy with the appointment of GE’s first Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). This position coordinates efforts by our business leaders, engineers, and strategic thinkers to ensure we improve our impacts to our communities, people and planet in measurable and meaningful ways. The CSO also supports efforts for GE’s technology and innovation to address pressing global climate-related challenges, mitigate potential risks, and explore opportunities. The CSO helps GE accelerate outcomes by promoting closer collaboration between GE’s leaders and governments, policymakers, NGOs, our investors, communities, and peers. The CSO also coordinates efforts to operationalize GE’s sustainability efforts by approaching sustainability with the same high expectations of rigor and accountability that we use to run our businesses, using lean principles and continuously improving toward our goals.

GE’s Chief Sustainability Officer convenes a business-wide Sustainability Council staffed by each GE business and corporate function. Typically, the Sustainability Council meets weekly and, in 2022, focused internally and externally on three overarching goals: (a) ensuring progress toward delivering on GE’s sustainability commitments; (b) improving and installing operational programs to address gaps in GE’s sustainability programs; and (c) building strong and independent ESG programs and operations for each business prior to their separation from GE so that sustainability is core to the new businesses on day one. The Sustainability Council partners with a diverse range of external stakeholders to deliver on our commitments, improve our programs and prepare for the separation. Beyond the Sustainability Council, sustainability at GE is the ultimate team effort, with GE’s employees united in realizing the success of our mission.
C1.3
(C1.3) Do you provide incentives for the management of climate-related issues, including the attainment of targets?
Provide incentives for the management of climate-related issues	Comment
Row 1	
No, not currently but we plan to introduce them in the next two years
It has been a challenge to set long-term financial targets while we have been in the midst of significant transformation into three independent public companies. After completion of the planned business separations, GE (which will be GE Aerospace at that time) plans to develop long-term incentive awards that include multi-year financial targets. We also anticipate that GE HealthCare and GE Vernova as standalone companies will do so as well, as ultimately will be determined by the compensation committees for those companies.

Description of process
Our Company strategy focuses on what is needed to build a sustainable world that works. Energy transition, precision health, future of flight—these are critical challenges facing our world, and GE has a meaningful role to play in providing global solutions for each. We seek to build on GE’s strengths in both innovating technologies and solutions to continue driving the global energy transition and creating resilience in our businesses’ strategies to adapt to potential risks from the range of potential pathways for decarbonization and other factors that could significantly affect GE’s approach in the decades ahead. We seek to continuously improve our processes to identify, assess and respond to these types of climate-related opportunities and risks, as this remains central to the strategy for our businesses.

Our enterprise risk management framework informs the process for long-term strategy reviews that each business undertakes annually, taking into account strategic, operational, financial, legal and compliance, and reputational risks. GE's enterprise risk management framework requires the business to: (i) define and identify enterprise risks; (ii) prioritize the top risks and opportunities; and (iii) assess existing action plans to mitigate risk. The process also requires the business to identify owners at each stage of the process, instilling business ownership throughout the risk assessment process. Each of our businesses has an enterprise risk management framework, and as part of their risk management processes, the businesses identify and assess top risks and consider mitigating actions at least quarterly. Our businesses assign management-level ownership for specific risk mitigating actions and report on key risks and actions they are taking at regular quarterly operating reviews. Our consideration of top climate-related risks and opportunities also feeds into our annual long-term strategy review process, during which our businesses evaluate a handful of key questions related to their long-term strategies.

In addition, cross-functional risk-focused committees and teams at the leadership level align strategic priorities and culture across the company. At the Corporate level, the Corporate Risk Working Group—a small group of key functional leaders, as well as the Chief Risk Officer—meets quarterly to assess enterprise-wide risks as well. The Audit Committee oversees GE’s enterprise risk management framework and receives a quarterly enterprise risk report from the Chief Risk Officer. GE business leaders also periodically review their risk management programs and top risks with the Audit Committee, and it is the business CEOs—rather than a compliance or legal professional— who lead discussions with the Audit Committee to provide strong business accountability for risk management. In addition, each business CEO meets regularly with the Board to review their strategies and operations. Our Governance Principles and committee charters define the risk areas for which each committee has ongoing oversight responsibility, with the Board, as a whole.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations, and policies. Regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirements for marketing our products and slow our ability to introduce new products, resulting in an adverse impact on our business. Furthermore, we make sales to U.S. and non-U.S. governments and other public sector customers, and we participate in various governmental financing programs, that require us to comply with strict governmental regulations, including climate-related requirements. As a U.S. government contractor, we are also subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits and investigations that can lead to fines, damages, or other penalties. Inability to comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect our status with government customers or our ability to participate in projects and could have collateral consequences such as suspension or debarment. Suspension or debarment, depending on the entity involved and length of time, can limit our ability to bid for new U.S. government contracts or business with other government-related customers, or to participate in projects involving multilateral development banks, and this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Refer to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (beginning on page 30) for further detail on these risks. See https://www.ge.com/sites/default/files/ge_ar2022_annualreport.pdf
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed or interpreted or enforced in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. Changes in environmental and climate change laws, regulations or policies (including carbon pricing, emission standards or sustainable finance, among others) affecting the power or aviation sectors could lead to additional costs or compliance requirements, a need for additional investment in product designs, require carbon offset investments or otherwise negatively impact our businesses or competitive position. Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from the government and regulatory environment and action from legal proceedings and compliance with integrity policies and procedures, including those relating to financial reporting, environmental, health and safety. Government and regulatory risk include the risk that the government or regulatory actions will impose additional cost on us or require us to make adverse changes to our business models or practices. The relative competitiveness of different types of our product and service offerings will continue to be impacted in ways that are uncertain by factors such as the adoption of climate change-related policies (such as carbon taxes, cap and trade regimes, increased efficiency standards or incentives or mandates for particular types of energy) at the national and sub-national levels or by private actors. Refer to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (beginning on page 30) for further detail on these risks. See https://www.ge.com/sites/default/files/ge_ar2022_annualreport.pdf
Technology	
Relevant, always included
GE’s success in advancing decarbonization objectives across our businesses will depend in part on the actions of governments, regulators, and others to invest in infrastructure, create appropriate market incentives and otherwise support development of new technologies. The process of developing new high-technology products and enhancing existing products to mitigate climate change is often complex, costly and uncertain, and we may pursue strategies or make investments that don’t prove to be commercially successful in the time frames expected or at all.
A failure by GE or other industry participants to invest successfully in these technological developments, or to adequately position our businesses to benefit from growth in adoption of new technologies, could adversely affect our competitive position, business, ability to attract and retain talent, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, we face increasing scrutiny and expectations from many customers, governments, regulators, investors, banks, project financiers and other stakeholders regarding the roles that the private sector and individual companies play in decarbonization, which can result in additional costs and pose various risks for companies like GE that serve carbon intensive industries or relative to progress we make over time in reducing emissions from our operations or products and achieving our publicly announced ambitions. We anticipate that we will continue to need to make investments in new technologies and capabilities and devote additional resources in response to the foregoing, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of those investments and actions. Trends related to the global energy transition and decarbonization, will affect the relative competitiveness of different types of product and services within and across our businesses. Important factors that could impact our businesses include the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets globally and the adoption and pace of implementation of climate change-related policies (such as carbon taxes, cap and trade regimes, increased efficiency standards, GHG emission reduction targets or commitments, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects) at the national and sub-national levels or by customers, investors or other private actors.
Legal	
Relevant, always included
We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings, commercial disputes, legal compliance risks and environmental, health and safety compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We, our representatives, and the industries in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulators, other governmental authorities and private sector entities or individuals in the U.S., the European Union, China and other jurisdictions, which have led or may, in certain circumstances, lead to enforcement actions, adverse changes to our business practices, fines and penalties, required remedial actions such as contaminated site clean-up or other environmental claims, or the assertion of private litigation claims and/or damages that could be material. Refer to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (beginning on page 30) for further detail on these risks. See https://www.ge.com/sites/default/files/ge_ar2022_annualreport.pdf
Market	
Relevant, always included
The business and operating results of our businesses have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the air transportation, power generation, renewable energy and other industries we serve. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages or difficulty obtaining financing for particular projects or due to macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical disruptions, changes in law or other challenges affecting the strength of the global economy. For example, in our Power and Renewable Energy businesses, our customers face a variety of challenges, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation, competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies); these dynamics can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses. In addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local entities. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Refer to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (beginning on page 30) for further detail on these risks. See https://www.ge.com/sites/default/files/ge_ar2022_annualreport.pdf
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
We monitor, assess and manage reputational risks that arise independently or in connection with strategic, operational, financial, or legal and compliance risks within our enterprise risk management framework.

GE faces increasing scrutiny and expectations from customers, governments, regulators, investors, banks, project financiers and other stakeholders regarding the roles that the private sector and individual companies play in decarbonization, which can result in additional costs and pose reputational or other risks.

In addition, many of our products and services involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure projects, such as commercial jet engines, gas turbines, onshore and offshore wind turbines or nuclear power generation, and accordingly the adverse impact of product quality issues can be significant. Actual or perceived design, production, performance or other quality issues related to new product introductions or existing product lines can result in reputational harm to our businesses, in addition to direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise.

Developing and maintaining products that meet or exceed these can be costly and technologically challenging, and may also involve extensive coordination of suppliers and highly skilled labor from thousands of workers; a failure to deliver products and services that meet these standards could have significant adverse financial, competitive or reputational effects. Quality, capability, compliance and sourcing issues experienced by third-party providers can also adversely affect our costs, margin rates and the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and result in liability and reputational harm.

Refer to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for further detail on these risks. See https://www.ge.com/sites/default/files/ge_ar2022_annualreport.pdf
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included
As part of our risk assessment process, we monitor and prepare for acute physical risks across our enterprise. This work is led by GE's business units. This includes monitoring and preparing for extreme weather risks, cyber threats, geopolitical issues, and other hazardous situations which could affect our business operations, supply chain, and people negatively. Each business approaches this risk assessment and management as part of their business continuity planning (BCP), including considering our suppliers, logistics, and servicing options.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, always included
For strategic planning and risk mitigation purposes, GE conducts analysis to understand the growing impact of climate on our supply chain footprint, including changed weather patterns, an increase in severe storms, rising sea levels. We assess the potential impact to our own operations as well as other aspects of our business planning, such as transportation, logistics, suppliers, and services. GE works in ~170 countries globally; understanding and mitigating risks requires a measure of local knowledge. GE relies heavily on regionally and locally deployed experts who manage our facilities and are able to manage hazards locally, as well as convey risk and opportunities to management. Refer to the Risk Factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for further detail on these risks.

Company-specific description
Given the nature of our businesses and the industries we serve, we must anticipate and respond to market, technological, regulatory and other changes driven by broader trends related to decarbonization efforts in response to climate change and energy security. These changes present both risks and opportunities for GE. For example, the significant decreases in recent years in the levelized cost of energy for renewable sources of power generation, along with ongoing changes in government, investor, customer and consumer policies, commitments, preferences and considerations related to climate change, in some cases have adversely affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for and the competitiveness of products and services related to fossil fuel-based power generation, including sales of new gas turbines and the utilization and servicing needs for existing gas power plants. Continued shifts toward greater penetration by renewables in both new capacity additions and the proportionate share of power generation, particularly depending on pace and timeframe for such shifts across different markets globally, could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our Power business and our consolidated results. While the currently anticipated market growth and power generation share for renewable energy is expected to be favorable for our wind businesses over time, we face uncertainties related to future levels and timeframes of government subsidies and credits (including the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act and other policies), significant price competition among wind equipment manufacturers, changing dynamics between onshore and offshore wind power, potential further consolidation in the wind industry, competition with solar power-based and other sources of renewable energy and others. The achievement of deep decarbonization goals for the power sector is likely to depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but that may become more important over time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, small modular or other advanced nuclear power and grid-scale batteries or other storage solutions). Similar dynamics exist in the aviation sector, where decarbonization over time will require a combination of continued technological innovation in the fuel efficiency of engines, expanded use of SAF and the development of electric flight and hydrogen-based aviation technologies.

Company-specific description
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and introduction time, customer service, financing terms, the ability to respond to shifts in market demand and others. Our long-term operating results and competitive position also depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative technology, products, services and platforms, to develop digital solutions for our own operations and our customers, to modify existing products and services, to customize products and services, to maintain long-term customer relationships and to increase our productivity over time as we perform on long-term service agreements.

Our businesses are also subject to technological change and advances, such as growth in industrial automation and increased digitization of the operations, infrastructure and solutions that customers demand across all the industries we serve. The introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies in the markets in which we operate also poses risks in the form of new competitors (including new entrants from outside our traditional industries, such as competitors from digital technology companies), market consolidation, substitutions of existing products, services or solutions, niche players, new business models and competitors that are faster to market with new or more cost-effective products or services. The research and development cycle involved in bringing products in our businesses to market is often lengthy, it is inherently difficult to predict the economic conditions or competitive dynamics that will exist when any new product is complete, and our investments, to the extent they result in bringing a product to market, may generate weaker returns than we anticipated at the outset. Our capacity to invest in research and development efforts to pursue advancement in a wide range of technologies, products and services also depends on the financial resources that we have available for such investment relative to other capital allocation priorities. Under-investment in research and development, or investment in technologies that prove to be less competitive in the future (at the expense of alternative investment opportunities not pursued), could lead to loss of sales of our products and services in the future, particularly in our long-cycle businesses that have longer product development cycles.

Company-specific description
At GE Aerospace, we never stop innovating. As one of the world’s largest suppliers of aircraft engines, systems and services, GE Aerospace continues to lead the industry in developing technologies to reduce CO2 emissions from flight. Advancements in aerodynamics, engine architecture and materials technology for GE and CFM International product lines have resulted in today’s aircraft engines consuming 40% less fuel and emitting 40% less CO2 than engines manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s. However, we cannot be satisfied with the pace of progress from the past. We are currently developing the next suite of engine technologies—including advanced architectures such as open fan, hybrid electric and electric propulsion concepts, and advanced thermal management concepts—that offer the potential to achieve at least a 20% additional improvement in fuel efficiency compared to today’s state-of-the-art, single-aisle aircraft engines. For example, GE Aerospace and Safran unveiled a bold technology development program in June 2021 called the CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) Program, which will demonstrate and mature a range of new, disruptive technologies for future engines that could enter service by the mid-2030s. GE Aerospace is also supporting industry initiatives to approve and adopt 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and is partnering on a flight demonstration program to test zero carbon hydrogen fuel combustion. GE spent nearly $2 billion on aviation research and development in 2022, including emissions-reducing technologies; continuing our efforts to support use of SAF, which is vital to enabling the airline industry to meet its decarbonization goals.

Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
This commitment to innovation and investment over decades has led to the following engines, services and software available now to reduce CO2 emissions from the existing fleet in service. Our newest engines are designed to offer better fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions than their predecessors with advances in engine architecture, aerodynamics, and advanced materials. Technologies such as Ceramic Matrix Composites and additive manufacturing have led to lighter parts with higher capabilities. As a result, today’s commercial aircraft engines consume 40% less fuel compared to engines manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition, GE Aerospace’s Systems business continues to bring additional efficiencies to aircraft performance. These technologies include power generation, conversion and distribution systems focused on electrification, avionics solutions that optimize flight paths, and more efficient and quieter integrated propeller systems. Toward a more circular economy, we also consider the lifecycle of our engines. Currently, there are more than 23,000 total repairs in our catalogs to restore worn GE and CFM12 engine parts to serviceable conditions. Additionally, GE and CFM12 industrialized more than1,800 repairs in 2022, increasing repair capability. As a result, GE maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities globally repaired approximately 2.3 million engine components in 2022 using these industrialized processes. Sustainable Aviation Fuel—or SAF for short—is jet fuel that can be made from plant-based material, fats, oils and greases, alcohols, waste streams, captured CO2, and other alternative feedstocks. GE Aerospace has been actively involved in assessing and qualifying SAF since 2007 and works closely with SAF producers, regulators and operators to ensure SAF can be widely adopted for use in aviation. Digital has software that can help airlines reduce CO2 emissions today, using data they already have. Right now, solutions like FlightPulse™ and Airspace Insight help pilots and airlines make data-driven strategic choices about flight routes that save on fuel and avoid releasing excess CO2 emissions. In years to come, GE Digital plans to help drive the industry towards a net zero future through new enhancements and features to solutions like Fuel Insight, which could allow airline customers to easily identify, track, and manage fuel initiatives.

We strongly support the Paris Agreement commitments and other ambitious targets to reduce energy sector emissions, and we are leading by example. Having met our 2020 emissions reduction targets ahead of schedule, we set a new goal to achieve carbon neutrality within our own operations (i.e., Scope 1 and 2 emissions) by 2030. To achieve this goal, our businesses are making operational investments in energy efficiency, reducing emissions from the grid through smart power sourcing and using lean practices to eliminate energy waste.

In 2021, GE announced an ambition to be a net zero company for its sold products by 2050, which is the most impactful and relevant emissions category given the nature of our businesses. Working with external advisors and experts, we further refined our focus to power turbines and aircraft engines, which account for the majority of GE’s greenhouse gas emissions across all reporting scopes. By focusing on the key levers we have as a company to impact the energy transition, we will more effectively deliver the type of technology innovations and breakthroughs our customers are relying on to achieve their own net zero ambitions. We are prioritizing the 2020s as a decade of action, with a focus on innovating the technology solutions needed to achieve net zero emissions in 2050. This will take several forms, including advancing technology with the potential to further reduce carbon emissions and carbon intensity in this decade and beyond. While we are optimistic about the role of GE’s technologies to make progress through 2030, we know they will not be enough to achieve 2050 net zero ambitions. We are investing today to innovate the next generation of breakthrough technologies to achieve the step changes that will be needed for the aviation sector.

Row 1
Focal questions
The overarching focal questions of our ongoing scenario analysis are: How could climate-related physical and transition risks plausibly affect our company? What should we do? When?

More specifically, the questions we have been focusing on through our scenario assessments are:

For GE Vernova:
• Potential innovation and technology pathways for electricity generation toward an ambition of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
• How the Company technology can contribute to decarbonization solutions and provide customer offerings to help navigate the energy transition with the full force of the Company capabilities across power generation equipment and services, grid planning, digital solutions, and financing.
• How electricity demand and supply could remain balanced over that time horizon with different combinations of power generation technology, as well as cost optimization for each pathway depending on the types of technology assumed to be available for use in the pathway.

For GE Aerospace:
• What are the potential technology and innovation pathways for the aviation sector to meet the Paris Climate Agreement and reduce emissions to the level needed to reach net zero emissions by 2050, acknowledging the Air Transport Association’s (IATA) suggestion for the industry to reduce 21.2 gigatons of CO2 now through 2050 to achieve net zero, while the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) forecasts aviation industry passenger traffic to grow 3% a year through 2050.
• How can the Company support the industry to improve engine fuel efficiency and the qualification of alternative fuels compatible with GE engines – while advancing the breakthrough innovations and ideas that will help the whole industry move even faster.

The scenario analysis was based on the transitional macro and micro forces to potentially impact the business, based on the STEEP categories — social, technological, economic, environmental, and policy.
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
Our businesses considered key themes and questions raised by this analysis as part of their annual long-term strategy reviews, including review during a strategy session with the GE Board of Directors.

The scenario assessment helps inform the strategy reviews in regards to what possible future developments need to be probed, what climate-related risks need to be incorporated into enterprise risk management processes, and what forces and developments have the greatest ability to shape future performance.

Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
GE is focused on innovating the technologies, products and services the world needs to achieve net zero emissions. We believe greater deployment of gas plant pre-combustion decarbonization technologies (hydrogen or renewable natural gas blending) and post-combustion carbon capture technologies (including retrofits of existing plants) could also support progress toward net zero. GE will continue its investments in onshore and offshore wind to improve capacity factors and to expand manufacturing capacity to support demand growth for renewables. Investments in grid hardware and software will also enable higher renewable penetrations without sacrificing required resilience and grid stability.
GE continued driving progress this decade with several significant milestones in 2022. Having worked through its backlog, GE had no sales for coal fired steam turbines in 2022, ending GE’s participation in any new coal plants globally. GE and Technip Energies began development of their front-end engineering design (FEED) study for a first-of-a-kind large amine-based, post-combustion carbon capture at scale solution to integrate with a proposed H-Class natural gas fired power plant at Teesside, England. During COP27, in a demonstration project at a thermal power plant operated by the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC), an LM6000 unit ran on a blend of natural gas and hydrogen, marking the first time the turbine has generated power from a hydrogen blend on the African continent.
Increased availability and use of SAF is critical to reduce emissions in the existing fleet of installed aircraft engines and future fleets. That’s why GE Aerospace is advocating for incentives that encourage greater development across the supply chain to make SAF more available and affordable compared to conventional jet fuel. GE’s proprietary 360 Foam Wash is an advanced on-wing cleaning technology to help ensure engines continue to operate efficiently. In some cases, GE’s 360 Foam Wash has been found to significantly improve engine performance by reducing build-up of deposits in the engine, lowering engine exhaust temperatures, and improving engine compressor efficiency. These improvements lead to reduced fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
In response to increasing scarcity of resources and the expectations from customers, investors, and regulators for producers to take heightened responsibility for the impacts of products across their full lifecycle, GE developed product stewardship and circularity goals in 2021. In 2022, GE businesses made progress towards achieving those goals while continuing to assess how to strengthen our efforts going forward. GE’s businesses continue to pursue the safety, environment, and external engagement goals identified on these pages. Over the past year, 100+personnel in over a dozen different functions were activated in the businesses to both assess the progress of existing circularity and product stewardship initiatives, and to draft objectives and roadmaps to further incorporate circularity and stewardship steps into the business strategy. This responsible approach to both our operations and products allows us to build upon the goals we’ve identified and continue to rise to the challenge of building a world that works.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
GE (company-wide, inclusive of GE HealthCare, customer, and partner funded) invested $4.2 billion in global R&D in 2022. Additionally, GE Research is our innovation engine where the solutions to our energy challenges are being developed and shaped today. Our ~1,000 scientists and engineers, including more than 500 Ph.Ds., partner with an expansive innovation network of industry, government and academic partners to achieve our sustainability goals across the energy sector and for the future of flight. In energy and aerospace specifically, GE researchers are focused on driving key technology advancements to deliver cleaner solutions on the ground and in the skies.

A failure by GE or other industry participants to invest successfully in these technological developments, or to adequately position our businesses to benefit from the growth in adoption of new technologies, could adversely affect our competitive position, business, ability to attract and retain talent, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, we face increasing scrutiny and expectations from many customers, governments, regulators, investors, banks, project financiers and other stakeholders regarding the roles that the private sector and individual companies play in decarbonization, which can result in additional costs and pose reputational or other risks for companies like GE that serve carbon intensive industries or relative to progress that we make over time in reducing emissions from our operations or products and achieving our publicly announced ambitions. We anticipate that we will continue to need to make investments in new technologies and capabilities and devote additional management and other resources in response to the foregoing, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of those investments and actions. Trends related to the global energy transition and decarbonization, will affect the relative competitiveness of different types of product and service offerings within and across our energy businesses and our Aerospace business. Important factors that could impact our businesses include the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption and pace of implementation of climate change-related policies (such as carbon taxes, cap and trade regimes, increased efficiency standards, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets or commitments, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects) at the national and sub-national levels or by customers, investors or other private actors. Although market factors related to the energy transition such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to impact long-term demand (and related financing), we expect the gas market to remain stable over the next decade with gas generation continuing to grow low-single-digits. We believe gas will play a critical role in the energy transition.

The airline industry, for example, is highly cyclical, and sustained economic growth and political stability in both developed and emerging markets are principal factors underlying long-term air traffic growth; the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and the potential for recession pose risks to the rate of that growth. Aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by the actions of a small group of large original equipment manufacturers, as well as large airlines in various geographies. We have significant business with, and credit exposure to, some of our largest aviation customers and accordingly our Aerospace business performance can be adversely affected by challenges that individual customers or the industry faces related to factors such as competition, the need for cost reduction, financial stability and soundness, and the availability of aircraft leasing and financing alternatives, the satisfaction of certification or other regulatory requirements for aircraft in various jurisdictions, the retirement of older aircraft and other dynamics affecting the original equipment and aftermarket service markets. As described above, the extended disruption of regional and international air travel from the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customers and suppliers. A potential future disruption in connection with a terrorist incident, cyberattack, actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary economic environment that results in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customers, their ability to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or at all, demand for our products and services and the viability of a customer’s business. In our Power and Renewable Energy businesses, our customers also face a variety of challenges, including in connection with decarbonization, industry consolidation, competition and shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of power projects or technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies); these dynamics can also have a significant impact on the operating results and outlooks for our businesses. In addition, our customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal government and state and local entities. We also at times face greater challenges collecting on receivables with customers that are sovereign governments or located in emerging markets. If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, in our industries, in financial markets or with particular significant counterparties, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
Having met our 2020 emissions reduction targets ahead of schedule, we set a new goal to achieve carbon neutrality within our own operations (i.e., Scope 1 and 2 emissions) by 2030. To achieve this goal, our businesses are making operational investments in energy efficiency, reducing emissions from the grid through smart power sourcing and using lean practices to eliminate energy waste. While we are focused on driving absolute reductions to achieve carbon neutrality, where necessary, we will balance remaining emissions with carbon offsets. GE internally tracks progress to established targets versus a 2019 baseline.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Our businesses are making operational investments in energy efficiency, reducing emissions from the grid through smart power sourcing and using lean practices to eliminate energy waste. While we are focused on driving absolute reductions to achieve carbon neutrality, where necessary, we will balance remaining emissions with carbon offsets. GE has reduced operational emissions by 28% through the end of the reporting year.

(C4.3c) What methods do you use to drive investment in emissions reduction activities?
Method	Comment
Partnering with governments on technology development
In 2022, we were awarded multiple funding grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
to accelerate the path towards 100% hydrogen combustion in gas turbines. In May 2022, we were awarded two projects totaling more than $12 million to develop and test key components required for high hydrogen combustion. In July 2022, DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E) recognized the value of developing alternative methods to boost the efficiency of gas turbines powered by fuel blends with high percentage of hydrogen by awarding GE $4.2 million. In October 2022, we were awarded $6.6 million to develop breakthrough technologies to help achieve 100% hydrogen combustion in GE Vernova’s F-Class gas turbines.

GE Vernova is in close collaboration with multiple strategic partners on the development and execution of a gas turbine carbon capture and sequestration system and currently working on multiple studies to optimize the integration of these existing technologies focusing on affordability, reliability and flexibility, and a small footprint to deliver this critical technology to the market.

Also in 2022, the U.S. DOE Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management awarded us additional funding focused on carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) for power generation applications.

Over the past five years, we have significantly grown our network of external partnerships with the U.S. government. With a portfolio of 237 programs worth $370 million, we are closely aligned on key research priorities to address climate change and help drive more sustainable air travel.
Dedicated budget for other emissions reduction activities
At GE Aerospace, we never stop innovating. As one of the world’s largest suppliers of aircraft engines, systems and services, GE Aerospace continues to lead the industry in developing technologies to reduce CO2 emissions from flight. To that end, GE spent nearly $2 billion (GE, customer and partner funded R&D) on aviation research and development in 2022, including emissions-reducing technologies. This commitment to innovation and investment over decades has led to the following engines, services and software available now to reduce CO2 emissions from the existing fleet in service.

Our newest engines are designed to offer better fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions than their predecessors with advances in engine architecture, aerodynamics and advanced materials. Technologies such as ceramic matrix composites and additive manufacturing have led to lighter parts with higher capabilities. As a result, today’s commercial aircraft engines consume 40% less fuel compared to engines manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s.

Toward a more circular economy, we also consider the lifecycle of our engines. Currently, there are more than 23,000 total repairs in our catalogs to restore worn GE and CFM International15 engine parts to serviceable conditions. Additionally, GE and CFM International15 industrialized more than 1,700 repairs in 2022, increasing repair capability. As a result, GE maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities globally repaired approximately 2.3 million engine components in 2022 using these industrialized processes. Additionally, our used serviceable materials business purchases used engines and parts, performs necessary inspections and repairs, and facilitates return of serviceable parts into the aviation industry. When metal parts are no longer repairable, they are recycled when possible.

GE Digital has software that can help airlines reduce CO2 emissions today, using data they already have. Right now, solutions like FlightPulse™ and Airspace Insight help pilots and airlines make data-driven strategic choices about flight routes that save on fuel and avoid releasing excess CO2 emissions.

Explain your calculation of avoided emissions, including any assumptions
Onshore wind turbines contribute to lowering the average carbon emissions of the grids on which they are deployed. The impact will vary based on (1) the specific grid mix where the project is built and (2) whether the new wind project is displacing or diluting existing grid assets. On the upper end of the emissions reduction range, displacing a coal generation asset, the wind turbine would reduce the GWP of the electricity by 0.94 to 1.34 kg of CO2-eq per kWh of electricity.

GWP figures:
Onshore Wind: ~0.01kg of CO2-eq per kWh of electricity (results from GE Cypress 5.5-158 EPD)
Coal: 0.95kg to 1.35kg of CO2-eq per kWh of electricity (values from EcoInvent Database, range based on country specific assumptions)

GE Renewable Energy businesses have embarked on the path of eco-design. One of the core pillars of eco-design is the lifecycle assessment of our products, where GE RE assesses the environmental impact of products through LCA methodology of ISO 14040. The LCA calculations are done via LCA software SimaPro. In terms of communication to the customer, GE RE is using eco-label type III certified EPDs (Environmental Product Declarations) and eco-label type II PEPs (Product Environmental Profiles). Internally, we are using the results of the LCA to drive continuous improvements of our products design, materials, and overall life-cycle environmental footprint. We use those environmental footprints to help guide the development of dedicated initiatives to lower the impacts and emissions of our products. LCAs are based on PEP-Ecopassport's Product Category Rules for Product Category Rules for Electrical, Electronic and HVAC-R Products (Edition 4), which covers thirty impact categories (http://www.pep-ecopassport.org/create-a-pep/produce-a-lca/)

GE Onshore Wind's (ONW) life cycle assessment measures the life cycle and efficiency of our products including the following metrics:
- Atmospheric Emissions (GHG, CO2, Methane, NOX, …)
- Ozone Layer Depletion
- Acidification
- Eutrophication
- Photochemical Oxidation
- Abiotic depletion
- Water Use
- Primary Energy

Life Cycle Assessments of GE ONW's products are performed according to ISO 14040 and utilize SimaPro LCA modelling software to perform the calculations. Communication of those results to the customer is done through a third-party certified Type III Environmental Product Declaration (EPD), performed according to ISO 14025 and the program operator rules of the Product Environmental Profile (PEP) EcoPassport program.

There is currently one certified EPD report for GE ONW products, performed and certified for the Cypress platform.

In 2022, new product Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) were conducted in GE Gas Power. Metrics used to measure the life cycle and efficiency of our Products (not limited to):
- Atmospheric Emissions (GHG, CO2, Methane, NOX, …)
- Waste (Solid, Waterborne, Other)
- Ozone Depletion Potential

Wind power has a significantly lower carbon footprint than conventional generation options, with average lifecycle CO2 emissions of 11g CO2e per kWh both onshore and offshore, according to analysts at Bernstein (source: https://rb.gy/ay7y7). This is compared to 450g for natural gas and 1,000g for coal. Since we have multiple product platforms and some where the carbon footprint has not yet been calculated, we have used the average lifecycle CO2 emissions of 0.011 tCO2eq/MWh to answer this question for all products except for the Cypress 158 product which has a product specific EPD, as described in Row 2 of this section. The % of total revenue reflects a numerator of total equipment. revenue, less Cypress equipment revenue divided by total revenue in the denominator (eqpt and serv.)

• Cost out activities use cost optimization as the metric, however in practice, that translates to a portfolio of projects that reduce raw materials, energy, and processing. From a performance perspective:
• Turbine availability: self-explanatory (total time online/total time). This has been a key focus area of the new GE ONW CEO, with daily stand-up meetings to highlight and address key turbine quality issues. New digital tools are being developed and deployed to reduce downtime.
• Performance improvement is measured in MWh improvement over the baseline. This is achieved through digital enhancements (PowerUp product) that enhance the turbines power curve based on site specific mechanical loads analysis that incorporate pad level wind conditions.

As stated for GE onshore wind turbine's product portfolio in this section (C-CG8.5a)- the conservative estimate for GWP provided by Bernstein for onshore wind turbines is used for those products for which GE has not yet conducted a product specific Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). Section 6 describes the intent to conduct LCA's and EPD's for all products. As of Dec. 31, 2022, there is only one third-party certified product specific EPD, which describes the impacts associated with the life of its Cypress product. The GWP of the Cypress product was 0.0102 tCO2e/MWh at the time of that study. Optimization activities are ongoing and are aligned with the program across the onshore wind portfolio. Key areas include cost-out, turbine availability and performance improvement as described in GE onshore wind turbine's product portfolio. The % of revenue reflects equipment only although service contracts could be estimated from the analysis done in the EPD. (GE Vernova Wind)

As part of GE Aerospace’s Net Zero 2050 commitment the company is researching and developing the ability to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its engines. The use of SAF is vital to enabling the aviation industry to meet its decarbonization goals. GE is supporting industry initiatives to approve and adopt 100% SAF that doesn’t require blending with conventional jet fuel. In 2022 several flight tests and ground tests were completed with results here:

-United Airlines successfully operated the first experimental flight from Chicago to Washington D.C with passengers using 100% SAF in 1 of the 2 CFM LEAP-1B engines.
- KLM and members of the SkyTeam Airline Alliance launched their inaugural Sustainable Flight Challenge. Departing from Amsterdam, KLM completed 2 flights, with a medium-range trip to Porto, Portugal, and a long-haul flight to Edmonton, Canada. KLM chose the Boeing 787 Dreamliner for its Edmonton run equipped with GEnx engines. These advanced turbofan jet engines used 39% blend SAF on their Canada run, with the capability to burn up to 50% SAF blends in each engine. KLM Cityhopper participated in the challenge with a GE-powered CF34-10E Embraer 190 using 39% SAF blend.
- GE completed a ground test of the Passport long-range business aviation engine using 100% SAF, demonstrating the engine’s capabilities. Testing was conducted with 1 engine over several days at GE’s Peebles Test Operations in Ohio. The purpose of the test was to assess the performance and operability of the engine technology with 100% SAF compared to conventional Jet A. The type of SAF used in the testing, HEFA-SPK, is the most widely available SAF today and can be made from cooking oil and other waste fats, oils, and greases.

As one of the world's leading wind turbine suppliers, GE ONW invests heavily in R&D of low carbon products and solutions. Combining ONW and OFW wind, hydro and innovative technologies, GE Renewable Energy has installed more than 400 GW of renewable capacity globally and has over 49,000 ONW turbines installed in more than 35 countries with a total installed capacity of 62 GW. Our portfolio of wind energy solutions includes a suite of onshore and offshore turbines, flexible support services ranging from development assistance to digital optimization, operations and maintenance, and the latest in wind power technology to upgrade existing fleet.

GE Vernova is investing today in innovation to decarbonize gas turbines in the future. Decarbonizing a gas turbine requires the supply of a low carbon fuel (e.g., hydrogen) and/or the capturing of carbon from the exhaust for transport offsite. GE Vernova is investing in both decarbonization pathways to ensure we have multiple solutions for our customers and the world to fulfill carbon reduction commitments. Our HA turbines can already work with up to 50% hydrogen/natural gas mix. We have more than 120 gas turbines worldwide using hydrogen blends for power generation with about 8.5 million operating hours in aggregate. Work is underway to extend the capability to 100% hydrogen in these machines by the end of the decade. There is significant and growing interest in hydrogen as a substitute for fossil fuels, driven by decarbonization goals. In 2022, we were awarded multiple funding grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to accelerate the path towards 100% hydrogen combustion in gas turbines. In May 2022, we were awarded two projects totaling more than $12 million to develop and test key components required for high hydrogen combustion.

GE HealthCare announced in 2022 the FDA pre-market approval (PMA) for its End-tidal (Et) Control software for general anesthesia delivery on its Aisys CS2Anesthesia Delivery System. GE HealthCare is the only manufacturer approved to offer general anesthesia delivery with end-tidal concentration control in the U.S. The company initially released the technology in Europe in 2010 and today, anesthesia providers use Et Control software to care for patients in over 100 countries.

Each year more than 300 million patients worldwide undergo surgical procedures, many of them requiring general anesthesia utilizing inhaled anesthetic agents at a cost of $1.2 billion annually. The Et Control software semi-automates the delivery of anesthesia using software, allowing anesthesia providers to set targets for end-tidal oxygen and anesthetic agent. Once targets are set, the software quickly achieves and maintains those targets, regardless of changes in the patient's hemodynamic and metabolic status. The Et Control software improves anesthesia delivery accuracy and simplifies workflows while reducing drug waste, lowering the cost of care and greenhouse gas emissions.

This feature provides a potential 44% decline in greenhouse gas emissions due to more efficient use of anesthetic agents.

GE’s portfolio of energy businesses, now called GE Vernova (including Renewable Energy business units Onshore Wind, Offshore Wind, Grid Solutions Equipment and Services, Hydro Solutions, Hybrids Solutions), is helping the energy sector solve for the energy trilemma of sustainability, reliability and affordability. GE believes the energy transition will require increased decarbonization and electrification of the power generation sector— lowering the carbon intensity of electricity itself as other sectors such as heavy industry, transportation and buildings look to the grid to achieve their decarbonization goals. Gains in lower carbon power generation from wind, solar, nuclear, sequestered or hydrogen powered gas turbines, hydroelectric power or other sources also rely on proper investment in the grid system to ensure we are locking in progress toward both goals. This electrification imperative is elevating the importance of investment in the electricity grid system itself, including both hardware and software enhancements, to deal with added stresses and opportunities to manage the variability of more renewable electrons, growing threats to the grid and increasing energy demand worldwide.

We are modernizing the physical grid to enable the integration of more renewable energy, while meeting increased demand. We are also reinforcing the network to withstand the growing threat of more severe weather and cyber risks.

Investments in grid hardware and software will also enable higher renewable penetrations without sacrificing required resilience and grid stability. GE is continuing investments in the grid of the future to orchestrate variability of renewable resource, address bi-directional flow of electricity from distributed resources, augment traditional forms of system inertia, and enable controllable loads such as EV charging or heat pumps to balance supply and demand. These investments will increase the potential for higher penetration of renewables on the grid and improve the carbon intensity of the power sector

GE Vernova believes a diverse suite of technologies and innovation will be key to decarbonizing the energy sector while growing resiliency. Our investments include renewable energy in the onshore and offshore wind sectors and grid modernization technology, all of which will contribute to net zero.

Wind project developers typically request the breakdown of the life cycle emissions associated to the wind turbine. And this is becoming an increasingly important requirement as non-price criteria are starting to become a weighted requirement in European wind auctions. Providing third party verified LCAs & EPDs enable GE Onshore wind (ONW) & GE Offshore wind (OFW) to publicly report on the level of environmental impact during the life cycle of its product and satisfy incoming customers' requests.

The LCAs & EPDs not only enable transparent communication to our stakeholders but also allow GE ONW & OFW to focus on how to reduce the environmental impacts across the life cycle in our new product introduction (NPI) process. We can use this info to inform our engineers, along with suppliers, of the product’s environmental impacts and incorporate design changes to minimize these impacts, thereby enabling potential innovations with a reduced carbon or material footprint.

The goal of this engagement is thus twofold: 1) satisfy incoming customer requirements, 2) implement iterative environmental design improvements into the design process.

GE ONW & OFW have agreed to participate in a Task Force related to the harmonization of the production and use of LCA data via WindEurope’s industry association. Here, GE ONW & OFW are working with several of its customers as well as competitors, to align on a harmonized methodology, to thereby enable better comparison of environmental impacts across industry members that will also enable a scientifically based, quantitative non-price criteria for the wind auctions. Here, "% of customers by number" is estimated at 33% as the project is currently focused on the wind industry in Europe. This is a conservative estimate because if the project is successful in reaching agreement amongst the industry members, the OEMs & wind developers who operate globally, will likely apply the adopted methodology in the other geographies in which they operate. Rationale for selecting this group of customers is due to their interests in, and supplier requirements for, life cycle data.

LM Wind Power is a member of the DecomBlades consortium in Denmark, which brings together leading players in the wind industry, recycling companies and universities to commercialize viable blade recycling solutions. In 2022, the company committed to producing zero-waste blades by 2030 by using new materials and reducing and recycling manufacturing waste as much as possible. It also joined the ZEBRA consortium, which stands for Zero wastE Blade ReseArch.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
ZEBRA aims to develop a recyclable blade, and this week it delivered the first prototype. LM Wind Power designed and made the 62-meter blade at its plant in Ponferrada, Spain, using a special resin from the French chemicals company Arkema and new high-performance glass materials supplied by Owens Corning. “With this project we are addressing two crucial industry challenges,” said John Korsgaard, senior director for engineering excellence at LM Wind Power. “On one hand, we are progressing on our zero-waste blades vision by preventing and recycling manufacturing waste. On the other, we are taking blade recyclability to a new level: The end-of-life thermoplastic composite blade material has high value in itself and can be readily utilized in other industries as material compounds but can also be depolymerized and the resin reused in the production of new blades.” LM Wind Power will now start full-scale structural lifetime testing at a test facility near its headquarters in Denmark. The aim is to verify the properties and performance of the blade and the suitability of the material for future sustainable blade production. Following the tests, the partners will also validate the recycling methods.

“The next steps are the recycling of production waste, the dismantling and recycling of this first blade and the analysis of the test results,” ZEBRA said in a press release. “By the end of the project in 2023, the consortium will have taken an important step in meeting the challenge of bringing the wind energy sector into the circular economy loop in a more sustainable manner, according to the principles of eco-design.”

The alliance selected the Ohio-Pennsylvania-West Virginia region because it has world-class universities and national laboratories, as well as strong industrial roots in manufacturing, materials and energy. Its workforce is highly skilled and experienced. And it has built a strong and growing start-up ecosystem. The northern Appalachian region, covering Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, has helped America tap its energy reservoir over the past 150 years, supplying the country with its first oil and coal. Now the area’s industry is seeking to pivot, lead the country to a lower-carbon future and create new jobs along the way. Seven companies, including GE Gas Power, have formed an alliance aiming to establish a low-carbon and hydrogen “industrial hub” for the tri-state area.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
The goal is to help decarbonize the industrial region by focusing on two technology pathways: hydrogen utilization and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS)—both of which can help reduce or mitigate carbon emissions from industries including power generation.

GE focuses its climate lobbying efforts on being a constructive voice in advancing policies that further a successful energy transition—the decarbonization of energy while growing access to reliable, sustainable, and affordable energy. Our lobbying activities are in furtherance of GE’s climate change goals, including the science and goals expressed in the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we support policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development. For example, GE has worked closely with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to establish the first-ever CO2 emissions standards for aircraft. GE has been on the record in support of both President Biden’s infrastructure initiative and clean energy tax credits, including launching a public advocacy campaign on the latter. GE engages in public policy discussions that impact our company, our workers, and our communities in areas such as aviation, energy, healthcare, international trade and investment, tax, data governance, rule of law and government procurement. These areas overlap with climate goals and we seek to inform discussions by promoting thoughtful civil discourse grounded in strong, fact-based and reasoned analysis. We work in partnership with governments because we know that tackling the world’s biggest challenges is only possible if governments, industry, venture capital, and academia work together as partners. GE employees engage with public officials at all levels of government in the United States and in some countries outside of the United States. GE conducts lobbying activities in compliance with applicable laws governing such activities and files appropriate reports.

Describe the process(es) your organization has in place to ensure that your external engagement activities are consistent with your climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
The GE Board of Directors Governance Committee, composed solely of independent directors, oversees the Company’s public policy and government relations activities, including policies and guidelines regarding political contributions and lobbying activities, and external reporting on such activities. This includes political and campaign contributions as well as any contributions to trade associations and other tax-exempt and similar organizations that may engage in political activity, including climate-related public policy.

In addition to robust Board oversight, GE has significant management level oversight over environmental and political activities. Our climate change and energy transition programs and policies are overseen by GE’s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). The CSO has day-to-day responsibility for climate change and sustainability matters and works closely with the Head of Government Affairs and Policy and representatives in relevant businesses allowing for even greater synergies and alignment of our lobbying activities with our climate strategy. The CSO also works closely with environmental NGOs, think tanks, industry coalitions, trade associations and other stakeholder to advance these policies. For example, at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum, our CSP examined the variety of immediate challenges to action, including the need to develop a full-fledged ecosystem to operationalize climate change commitments in to action.

GE’s Chief Sustainability Officer and GE’s Head of Government Affairs and Policy are regularly briefed on and help develop our policy priorities and activities; and our Governance Committee also receives formal reports on our political activities. To proactively develop and advance climate change policy positions and related strategy consistent with GE’s climate change goals, we leverage the experience of a broad cross functional team, inclusive of representatives from our Sustainability, Legal, Government Affairs, Risk, Financial and Investor Relations groups as well as advice received in consultation with outside specialists.

Inflation Reduction Act Act – legislation in 2022 and regulations in 2022-23. GE supports the clean energy tax incentives that were enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These incentives will speed the U.S. transition to decarbonizing the energy sector and enhance U.S. development of new energy technologies. The incentives will also promote U.S. manufacturing and U.S. jobs both today and in the future. GE has been actively working with government leaders, policymakers and industry allies on implementing guidance and proposed rules to ensure the success of these important incentive programs across a range of energy sources, including wind, carbon sequestration, nuclear, transmission, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), and on the manufacturing incentives that support these energy sources.

Description of engagement with policy makers
GE’s engagement on the IRA when it was being considered in Congress:
GE strongly advocated for the inclusion of multiple provisions in the IRA, including clean energy tax credits to ensure success in decarbonization efforts and continued U.S. leadership in energy manufacturing and jobs – both today and in the future. GE supports clean energy tax credits and technology demonstrations to ensure success in decarbonization efforts and continued U.S. leadership in energy manufacturing and jobs – both today and in the future. An all-inclusive approach across the energy industry avoids the arbitrary selection of winners and losers and gives room for markets to work. A comprehensive package of clean energy tax credits would support diverse generation sources, such as wind, solar, carbon sequestration and nuclear, while creating new incentives for storage (including pumped hydro storage), hydrogen, and transmission, as well as manufacturing credits.

Throughout the summer of 2022, GE launched a grassroots public advocacy campaign, which delivered nearly 1,300 letters to members of Congress representing 34 states. The campaign urged Congress and the Biden administration to pass a comprehensive package of clean energy tax credits, including wind production tax credit and 45Q tax credit for carbon sequestration, as well as tax credits to support diverse generation sources, such as wind, solar, and nuclear. During a four-month digital advertising campaign, GE also shared information with key stakeholders strongly supporting these issues, including members of Congress, Congressional staff, policymakers across Washington, D.C., and the general public.

GE’s ongoing engagement with Administration officials on the implementing regulations:
GE has engaged with relevant officials in the Department of Energy, Treasury, and the White House to provide technical input on the regulatory guidance that is currently being written to implement the clean energy tax credits that were enacted in the IRA. GE has also worked through trade associations to align industry views on the implementing guidance, given the large task facing the Administration in providing so much new guidance in a short period of time. Finally, GE has engaged with key members of Congress to update them on our views of the guidance, as it is being written. GE’s goal through all of our engagements is to facilitate the timely release of final rules that will bring the new energy incentives into operation.

GE Aerospace supports aviation industry efforts to decarbonize, which requires a holistic, global approach. Meeting the industry’s goal of net zero CO2 emissions from flight by 2050 requires deploying revolutionary technologies to reduce emissions and to advocate for increased use and availability of alternative fuels, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Following similar aviation industry targets, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) member states in 2022 adopted a collective long-term global aspirational goal of net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The milestone agreement signalled government backing for the industry’s sustainability ambitions. Members of Air Transport Action Group, including GE Aerospace, previously adopted a goal of net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, confirming the aviation industry’s commitment to reduce CO2 emissions in support of the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. GE and CFM International are funding members with representation on the Board of Directors of ATAG. GE Aerospace is also a member of the U.S. Aerospace Industries Association, which has a similar target for commercial aviation manufacturers to work with airline customers and governments globally to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The European Commission is also on an ambitious trajectory to reduce CO2 emissions from flight. While governments work on legislative proposals, the European aviation industry issued Destination 2050, a report supported by GE Aerospace, announcing a pathway to net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and a 55% reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

GE supported the expansion of the Section 45Q tax credit for Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) in the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as funding to enable the use of Hydrogen as fuel for power generation in gas turbines. GE believes that the deployment of gas power (which can be decarbonized through the use of CCUS technology or the use of Hydrogen as a fuel) can help to increase the deployment of renewables. High-efficiency gas power can be deployed quickly and at scale, requiring less land and ensuring consistent power generation. We advocate for increased funding in research and development and incentive mechanisms to accelerate cost effective carbon capture utilization and storage and hydrogen for dependable capacity to complement renewables.

Description of engagement with policy makers
At the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) meeting in November 2022, global leaders in government, non-profits and industry gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Taking to heart Egypt’s focus on COP27 as the “implementation summit,” GE prioritized action with a focus on three proof points—emphasizing the importance of emerging economies; demonstrating the feasibility of breakthrough technologies; and strengthening public-private partnerships.

COP28 (Nov 2023) marks the first global stocktake since the Paris Climate Agreement and is expected to show that a course correction is required to bring the world back on track to achieve the 1.5 degree Celsius target. COP28 aims to focus on reducing emissions while showing progress on climate adaptation, climate mitigation and climate finance; to “mobilize for the most inclusive COP”, which brings together women, youth, representative populations from around the world, people of determination, and others to ensure their contributions throughout the COP28 program; and to engage the energy industry in decarbonization efforts, while working to increase renewables capacity, and promoting low-carbon technologies to support curb the impacts of climate change.

GE supports the COP28 Presidency in these efforts, and is engaging with policymakers, industry actors, partners, and other relevant stakeholders with a focus on action-oriented, impact-focused steps to support global decarbonization and energy transition efforts.

GE has engaged with the COP28 Presidency team along with policymakers in the UAE, US, and global governments to highlight the importance of policies that promote breakthrough technology and innovation. GE has also supported policies that positively impact the energy transition while also ensuring energy security and energy access to populations around the world.

GE is working with partners on initiatives which support the research and development of next generation clean and low-carbon technologies and solutions, while working with policymakers to ensure a environment and ecosystem that allows the future deployment of such technologies.

GE has supported spearheading the activities of the Corporate Coalition for Innovation and Technology towards Net-Zero (CCITNZ) which aims to partner with governments, international organizations and others in industry to help countries meet decarbonization and climate change goals.

Description of engagement with policy makers
GE engaged with policymakers in the U.S. Congress and Biden Administration regarding expanding domestic production of transformers to enable electrification of the economy. GE participated in a Department of Energy led inter-government task force to expand manufacturing of distribution transformers to enable increased electric vehicle adoption as well as the expansion of heat pumps for HVAC and water heating. GE hosted several administration officials for a tour of our GE-Prolec transformer manufacturing facility that included discussions on supply chain, workforce, policy, and regulatory barriers to production expansion. GE advocated for the expanded use of 48C and the Defense Production Act in support of expanding domestic manufacturing capacity. GE advocated for R&D programs supporting the resilience and modernization of transformers as well as increased public-private coordination to ensure a robust supply chain and workforce. GE also has been at the center of discussions and efforts with global governments and stakeholders to ensure policies can enable support for Ukraine’s energy grid.

The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) supports a binding climate treaty to keep post-industrial warming of the planet to well below 2 degrees and approaching 1.5 degrees. We believe these ambitions are consistent with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. GE plays an active role on NAM’s environment committee and worked to update the NAM’s policy on climate in 2020, which brought it more closely aligned to GE’s climate policy position and the Paris Climate Agreement. We continue to engage with the NAM on our key energy transition priorities, including onshore wind production tax credits, 45Q enhancements, and supporting production incentives for sustainable aviation fuel. For example, GE supported the clean energy tax incentives being discussed in Congress and we believe it is important for the NAM to recognize that these provisions support manufacturers of clean energy power generation equipment. Also, NAM opposed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for reasons that were unrelated to the clean energy tax incentives. The reasons for this opposition were grounded in broadly applicable tax policies that affected many of their members. GE discussed the importance of the clean energy tax incentives with NAM and confirmed their leadership understands these tax incentives will help keep the U.S. a leader in clean energy technology and innovation toward decarbonization goals. Since the enactment of the IRA, NAM has supported policies to enable the success of the IRA tax credits through being a constructive voice on permitting reform.

Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) states that as governments across the world commit to decarbonization goals—including President Joe Biden's target for the US to reach net-zero emissions by no later than 2050—it is imperative we utilize all carbon-free energy tools. Nuclear power reactors are the ideal carbon-free, 24/7/365 partner to wind turbines, solar panels, and energy storage. Our current investment in carbon-free energy isn't enough. To address the climate crisis, we must embrace a carbon-free future. GE supports policies that value low-carbon and emissions-free energy sources, such as nuclear power generation, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and embrace the important role of existing (and future) nuclear power plants in the energy mix to provide reliable base-load electricity.
