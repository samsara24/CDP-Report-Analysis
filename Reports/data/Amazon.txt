C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
  

Amazon is a global company with approximately 1.5 million full- and part-time employees worldwide and operations in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, India, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America. We strive to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, Earth’s best employer, and Earth’s safest place to work in the industries in which we operate.



We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Our dedication to delighting customers drives us to constantly invent on their behalf and has led to the launch of many innovations, including 1-Click shopping, Alexa, Amazon Echo, Amazon Studios, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Career Choice, customer reviews, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Fulfillment by Amazon, Just Walk Out technology, Kindle, Kindle Direct Publishing, personalized recommendations, Prime, and The Climate Pledge.



We put our customers at the heart of everything we do and relentlessly innovate to meet their needs, enrich their lives, and make every day better. With our mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company comes an innate aspiration to address the environmental and social challenges our customers and communities face—from the impacts of climate change to social inequity. While these issues are increasingly complex, urgent, and interconnected, we believe in the potential for solutions driven by ingenuity and collaborative action. As an organization serving global communities, we have a broad responsibility to mitigate the impacts of our business, while helping to address the environmental and social challenges we collectively face. We use our scale and culture of innovation to help create a more sustainable future.



Scaling our positive impact is underpinned by The Climate Pledge—a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040—which we co-founded in 2019. The Climate Pledge brings together the world’s top companies to accelerate joint action, cross-sector collaboration, and responsible change. More than 390 companies across 36 countries signed the Pledge by the end of 2022, and we are determined to keep bringing on new partners to help combat climate change.

Further details of incentive(s)
Amazon’s Sustainability Ambassador program empowers and recognizes our employees’ engagement in sustainable practices, both at home and at work, through internal recognition. We leverage internal employee communication channels to recognize and highlight sustainability success stories spearheaded by Ambassadors across our global workforce.
Sustainability Ambassadors are sustainability minded Amazon employees who work to amplify global, companywide efforts at the local level. Ambassadors lead projects on Amazon campuses and create virtual engagement opportunities to inspire fellow employees. The program also serves as a community for sharing best practices among teams in different settings and locations.
Our Sustainability Ambassadors (WWSA) are supported and enabled in driving sustainable process changes at their sites through resources, training and guidance from Amazon’s sustainability organization. They have leadership support in rolling out site-level initiatives that impact our sustainability and climate goals. Yearly, Sustainability Ambassador chapters that deliver on enacting sustainable change at their sites, are recognized through the Ambassador Awards. The Ambassador Awards have been developed to recognize the work the Ambassador chapters do on a local level, with successful chapters receiving internal recognition within our employee network.
Since launching in 2018, the Sustainability Ambassador program has transformed into a collaborative network across 1,246 global locations. As of 2022, more than 8,420 Amazon employees participate in the program.

Explain how this incentive contributes to the implementation of your organization’s climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
The Sustainability Ambassador program enables and recognizes employees’ contributions across all our teams that drive positive change impacting our environmental and climate impact. One example is the Sustainability Ambassador Roadmap, a set of seven initiatives across employee training and engagement opportunities, that chapters can implement at their sites to drive change in energy, water and waste practices. Ambassador chapters are also supported in communicating their impact to their leadership teams and colleagues through the Sustainability Gemba board, which tracks sustainability metrics and progress on their continuous improvement projects.

C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
For purposes of CDP reporting, we define “substantive financial or strategic impact” as an impact that significantly affects our business strategy or our ability to continuously serve our primary customer sets on a global level. We evaluate the potential impact of a risk or opportunity by considering, among other things, its implications for our stakeholders, our ability to leverage our scale to foster or advance progress in addressing a risk or opportunity, the expected time horizon for the risk or opportunity, the range of uncertainty in its magnitude, the likelihood of occurrence, and the regulatory and technological landscape. Our assessment that a risk or opportunity has the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on our business does not mean that it is material to Amazon’s business or operating results under U.S. securities laws. We monitor risks and prioritize opportunities by taking into account customer and stakeholder expectations, voluntary practices and regulations, industry best practices, trends in financial and sustainability reporting, and emerging topics in news and social media.

Description of process
We consider climate risks and opportunities through our management of customer and stakeholder expectations, regulations, business risks, industry best practices, and emerging trends. Mechanisms are embedded across our business operations and strategic decision-making to address sustainability issues, including climate related risks. We integrate sustainability practices into our everyday operations by thinking through risks and opportunities related to projects and initiatives, as well as setting goals, developing metrics and conducting a regular cadence of leadership reviews.

We have developed a comprehensive carbon system of record and hold quarterly business reviews with Amazon leadership teams to track progress toward meeting The Climate Pledge—a commitment to be net-zero carbon across our business by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.

We also develop data and tools to address physical climate risks for both our business and our customers, like the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI), which helps researchers, scientists, and innovators around the world advance their work on sustainability-related research. The program provides publicly available, free access to important scientific data that can otherwise be hard for researchers to access or analyze.

ASDI works with scientific organizations around the world to identify important datasets, which are then hosted for free by the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program. The program currently hosts petabytes of data including weather observations, ocean temperatures, climate projection data, and satellite imagery. Our approach allows sustainability experts to analyze massive amounts of data in minutes, regardless of where they are in the world or how much local storage space or computing capacity they can access.

Company-specific description
Scaling up the use of renewable energy is central to Amazon’s strategy to decarbonize our operations. Clean energy sources, such as wind and solar, lessen Amazon’s reliance on fossil fuels to power our operations and the services we provide to customers. We procure new renewable energy beyond the existing grid mix through off-site contracts for wind and solar, on-site rooftop solar installations, and green tariffs with local utilities that result in new projects being added to the grid. As part of our goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2040, Amazon is on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of our original target of 2030. In 2022, we were the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, reaching 90% electricity consumed by Amazon attributable to renewable energy sources. We are also making large-scale investments in wind and solar farm capacity, which will produce the clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by all Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide by 2025 and help bring additional clean energy infrastructure to the grid.

Cost to realize opportunity
Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
Since 2014, Amazon has invested in global renewable energy generation to decarbonize our business across our worldwide operations because transitioning to renewable energy is one of the highest-impact ways to immediately lower emissions.

We are on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of our original target of 2030. Additionally, we are scaling up renewable energy to produce the clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by all Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide by 2025.

We procure new renewable energy through contracts for utility-scale wind and solar, on-site rooftop solar installations, and green tariffs with local utilities that deliver new, renewable energy to the grids where we operate.

With 401 renewable projects announced as of the end of 2022, Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy and we reached 90% electricity consumed attributable to renewable energy sources, with over 20 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy production capacity across our global portfolio. Once these projects are fully operational, they are expected to deliver up to 56,881 gigawatt-hours of energy annually— the electricity output equivalent to powering up to 5.3 million U.S. homes for one year.

Explain why your organization does not have a climate transition plan that aligns with a 1.5°C world and any plans to develop one in the future
We have a limited window to make unprecedented headway in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C by 2050. To drive collective, cross-sector action on the climate crisis, and signal the urgent need for new solutions, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019. The Climate Pledge is a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040—ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement.

Amazon’s annual sustainability report details our 2022 carbon footprint and progress toward achieving our commitment to net zero carbon.

We aim to achieve our commitment through two complementary actions: carbon elimination and, for remaining carbon impact that cannot be eliminated, carbon neutralization. We are innovating and investing to eliminate emissions within the value chain of our businesses. Second, we are driving actions outside of our value chain, through nature-based and technological solutions, to enable a credible carbon market for companies that will need to neutralize remaining emissions.

Our focus areas include:
1. Renewable Energy. Powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030. In 2022, we reached 90% renewable electricity consumed by Amazon attributable to renewable energy sources. We also have made a commitment to produce the clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by all Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide by 2025.
2. Constructing more-sustainable buildings. We are investing in technologies to reduce the embodied carbon of building materials, designing for energy efficiency, electrifying buildings and eliminating fossil fuels, installing on-site solar installations, among other solutions.
3. Nature Based Solutions. Amazon's $100M Right Now Climate Fund aims to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Our approach focuses on three actions: reducing deforestation to near zero, especially in tropical regions; scaling up removal of carbon from the atmosphere, and; scaling up carbon-removal technologies.

Devices: In 2020, Amazon also became the first consumer electronics company to commit to addressing the electricity used by our devices through renewable energy development, starting with our Echo devices. To meet that goal we are making investments in wind and solar farm capacity that, by 2025, are expected to be equal to the energy use of Fire TV and Ring devices worldwide. We expect these projects will produce over 5 million megawatt-hours of clean energy per year.

Amazon Web Services (AWS): Studies by 451 Research found that moving on-premises computing workloads to AWS can lower workload carbon footprint by nearly 80% compared to surveyed enterprise data centers. That number could improve to as high as 96% once AWS is powered with 100% renewable energy—a target we are on path to meet by 2025. AWS’ infrastructure is 3.6x more energy efficient than the median of surveyed U.S. enterprise data centers and up to 5x more energy efficient than the average European enterprise data center.

Climate Pledge Friendly: On Amazon.com Amazon-branded products and third-party items that feature sustainability certifications through our Climate Pledge Friendly program now receive the Climate Pledge Friendly badging. In 2022, more than 818 million Climate Pledge Friendly units were sold to Amazon customers and we have a total of 52 third‑party sustainability certifications in the Climate Pledge Friendly program (as of December 2022).

Amazon is developing data and tools to address climate risks for both our business and our customers, an example of this is the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI), a global and authoritative source for open-sourced weather, climate, and sustainability data. This data, together with AWS analytical tools, is enabling cutting-edge scientific work and helping us raise the bar for customers. ASDI works with scientific organizations like NOAA, NASA, the UK Met Office, and The Queensland Government to identify, host, and deploy key datasets on the AWS Cloud, including weather observations, weather forecasts, climate projection data, satellite imagery, hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data. Our ultimate goal is to enable customers and suppliers to use the tools we are developing in-house to improve climate resilience.

In addition, the Climate Pledge Fund is a corporate venture capital fund that invests in companies that can accelerate Amazon’s path to meeting The Climate Pledge. Amazon launched The Climate Pledge Fund in 2020 to support the development of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies and services. This dedicated investment program—with $2 billion in funding—invests in visionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The time horizon for these investments varies, but some are achieving results in the short-term. For example, we have invested in CarbonCure Technologies, which has commercialized lower carbon concrete, and are working to lower the embodied carbon footprint of our buildings by using CarbonCure concrete in new construction, including in Amazon’s second headquarters in Virginia, with construction expected to finish in 2025.
Operations	
Yes
We are responding to climate- and water-related risks in our operations by improving efficiency. For example, AWS is continuously working to increase the efficiency of our facilities, and our scale allows us to achieve higher resource utilization and efficiency than typical on-premises data centers. AWS develops our water-use strategy by evaluating climate patterns for each AWS Region, local water management and availability, and the opportunity to conserve drinking water sources. Taking a holistic approach, we assess both the water and energy usage of each potential cooling solution to select the most efficient method. When possible, we incorporate direct evaporative technology for cooling our data centers, reducing energy and water consumption.

AWS strives to reduce embodied carbon associated with concrete and steel, the two most carbon-intensive materials used to build our data centers. This includes carbon emitted during extraction, manufacturing, and transportation of materials to data center construction sites. We are working with various suppliers on lower-carbon concrete options. For example, in Northern Virginia, AWS worked with building material provider Holcim to procure ECOPact concrete for several data centers. The concrete mix reduces carbon emissions by nearly 40% compared to standard concrete. AWS worked with American Rock Products (ARP), a CRH Company, to develop a more sustainable concrete mix for data centers across northeastern Oregon. ARP completed Environmental Product Declarations, which summarize environmental impacts across the concrete’s lifecycle, for all products at their plants. Globally in 2022, we completed the construction of 16 data centers using lower-carbon concrete and 10 data centers using lower-carbon steel. We expect these numbers to grow considerably in 2023.

Capital expenditures
Transportation is a major component of Amazon’s business operations and a key part of our plan to reach net-zero carbon by 2040. We are optimizing and transforming our transportation network through technological innovations, efficiency enhancements, and alternative solutions that allow us to deliver packages to our customers more sustainably. In 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 new electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, a U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer. This order, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles, sends a signal to the marketplace to start inventing and developing new technologies that large, global companies need to transition to a low-carbon economy. At the end of 2022, more than 2,600 Rivian electric delivery vans were on the road in the U.S., and we aim to have 100,000 on the road by 2030. Throughout 2022, we had more than 9,000 EVs in our fleet and delivered 145 million packages to customers via EV across the U.S. and Europe. We also scaled EV adoption in Indian operations, deploying over 3,800 EVs in our last-mile delivery fleet, as well as 158 middle-mile EVs, by the end of 2022.

In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge— a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across our business by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The target covers our Scope 1+2 emissions, as well as certain Scope 3 emissions associated with: Purchased Goods & Services; Capital Goods; Fuel- and Energy- Related Activities; Upstream Transportation and Distribution; Business Travel; Employee Commuting (Amazon-provided shuttles and certain employer subsidized transit); Downstream Transportation and Distribution; Use of Sold Products.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
We aim to achieve our commitment through two complementary actions: carbon elimination and, for remaining carbon impact that cannot be eliminated, carbon neutralization. We are innovating and investing to eliminate emissions within the value chain of our businesses. Second, we are driving actions outside of our value chain, through nature-based and technological solutions, to enable a credible carbon market for companies that will need to neutralize remaining emissions.
Our focus areas include:
1. Renewable Energy. Powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030. In 2022, we reached 90% renewable electricity consumed by Amazon attributable to renewable energy sources. We also have made a commitment to procure the clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by all Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide by 2025.
2. Constructing more-sustainable buildings. We are investing in technologies to reduce the embodied carbon of building materials, designing for energy efficiency, electrifying buildings and eliminating fossil fuels, installing on-site solar installations, among other solutions.
3. Nature Based Solutions. Amazon's $100M Right Now Climate Fund aims to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Our approach focuses on three actions: Reducing deforestation to near zero, especially in tropical regions; scaling up removal of carbon from the atmosphere, and; scaling up carbon removal technologies.

In 2022, we reached 90% renewable electricity consumed by Amazon attributable to renewable energy sources, with more than 20 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy production capacity across our global portfolio. Our projects supply renewable energy for a variety of Amazon facilities, including corporate offices, fulfillment centers, data centers, and physical stores, which collectively serve millions of customers globally. These projects also help meet Amazon’s commitment to procure the clean energy equivalent of the electricity used by every customer’s Echo device. We are making additional large-scale investments in wind and solar farm capacity, which will produce the clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by all Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide by 2025.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
In 2022, three new on-site rooftop solar projects became operational at Japanese fulfilment centers, increasing the number of facilities with on-site solar in Japan to six. In October 2022, we opened our first standalone Australian sort center in Melbourne, which features 3078 on-site solar panels with capacity to meet up to 80 percent of the site’s electricity needs. We also announced on-site solar projects in Canada, France, and Germany throughout the year.
We announced 133 new renewable energy projects that are expected to come online over the next five years, bringing our total announced projects to 401 as of end of 2022. Notably, for off-site projects, we announced our first South American project, a 122-MW solar farm in Brazil. Newly announced Indian solar projects—which bring our total number of utility-scale renewable projects in India to 6—are expected to have capacity of 920 MW once operational. We also announced our first utility-scale renewable energy projects in Indonesia and Poland. Utility-scale projects in the U.S., Japan, Germany, Finland, France, Poland, Singapore, and Spain were also announced in 2022.
Several previously announced projects became operational for the first time in 2022. In New South Wales, Australia, two solar farms became operational and are predicted to collectively generate 372 thousand megawatt-hours (MWh) annually. Five projects in Europe, two solar farms in Spain and Italy and three wind farms in Sweden and the UK, went live and together are expected to generate 1.9 million MWh annually. Two projects in China, one wind farm and one solar farm, also launched and are expected to produce about 450 thousand MWh annually.

In 2022, we reached 90% renewable electricity consumed by Amazon attributable to renewable energy sources, with more than 20 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy production capacity across our global portfolio. Once these projects are fully operational, they are expected to deliver up to 56881 gigawatt-hours of energy annually— the electricity output equivalent to powering more than 5.3 million U.S. homes for one year. We remain the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for the third year in a row. In 2022, the electricity consumed in the following 19 AWS regions was attributable to 100% renewable energy: U.S. East (Northern Virginia), GovCloud (U.S. East), U.S. East (Ohio), U.S. West (Oregon), GovCloud (U.S. West), U.S. West (Northern California), Canada (Central), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (London), Europe (Milan), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (Spain), Europe (Zurich), Asia-Pacific (Mumbai), Asia- Pacific (Hyderabad), China (Beijing), and China (Ningxia).

Is this a science-based target?
Yes, we consider this a science-based target, but we have not committed to seek validation of this target by the Science Based Targets initiative within the next two years
Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge— a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across our business by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The target covers our Scope 1+2 emissions, as well as certain Scope 3 emissions associated with: Purchased Goods & Services; Capital Goods; Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities; Upstream Transportation and Distribution; Business Travel; Employee Commuting (Amazon-provided shuttles and certain employer subsidized transit); Downstream Transportation and Distribution; Use of Sold Products.
Do you intend to neutralize any unabated emissions with permanent carbon removals at the target year?
Yes
Planned milestones and/or near-term investments for neutralization at target year
We aim to achieve our commitment through two complementary actions: carbon elimination and, for remaining carbon impact that cannot be eliminated, carbon neutralization. We are innovating and investing to eliminate emissions within the value chain of our businesses. Second, we are driving actions outside of our value chain, through nature-based and technological solutions, to enable a credible carbon market for companies that will need to neutralize remaining emissions.
Our focus areas include:
1. Renewable Energy. Powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030. In 2022, we reached 90% renewable electricity consumed by Amazon attributable to renewable energy sources. We also have made a commitment to procure the clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by all Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide by 2025.
2. Constructing more-sustainable buildings. We are investing in technologies to reduce the embodied carbon of building materials, designing for energy efficiency, electrifying buildings and eliminating fossil fuels, installing on-site solar installations, among other solutions.
3. Nature Based Solutions. Amazon's $100M Right Now Climate Fund aims to restore and conserve forests, wetlands, and grasslands around the world. Our approach focuses on three actions: Reducing deforestation to near zero, especially in tropical regions; scaling up removal of carbon from the atmosphere, and; scaling up carbon-removal technologies.

C4.3c
(C4.3c) What methods do you use to drive investment in emissions reduction activities?
Method	Comment
Compliance with regulatory requirements/standards
We work with organizations and regulatory bodies around the globe to promote transparent and comparable climate reporting, because measurement is critical as we work toward our goal of net zero carbon by 2040. We must measure and understand emissions in order to eliminate them and we are working to improve the granularity of data available.
Employee engagement
With more than 1.5 million full and parti-time employees worldwide, employee engagement is fundamental to our success. Our goal is to hear from and listen to all of our employees. We have a variety of engagement, feedback, and remediation mechanisms that help us continually improve our workplace experience. For example, Sustainability Ambassadors are sustainability minded Amazon employees who work to amplify global, companywide efforts at the local level. Ambassadors lead projects on Amazon campuses and create engagement opportunities to inspire fellow employees, both at work and at home. The program also serves as a community for sharing best practices among teams in different settings and locations. Since launching in 2018, the Sustainability Ambassador program has transformed into a collaborative network across 1,246 global locations. As of 2022, more than 8,420 Amazon employees participate in the program.
Other (Energy Efficiency)
We are using innovation to improve power efficiency in multiple ways, including our investment in AWS-designed chips. Our third-generation Arm-based chip, AWS Graviton3, is more energy efficient, as Graviton3-based Elastic Cloud Compute instances use up to 60% less energy for the same performance than comparable Amazon EC2 instances. In 2022, we launched AWS Trainium, a high-performance machine learning chip designed to reduce the time and cost of training generative AI models—cutting training time for some models from months to hours. This, in turn, means building new models requires less money and power. Inferentia is our most power efficient machine learning inference chip. Our Inferentia machine learning chip is up to 54% more energy-efficient and can reduce costs by up to 90% than comparable instances. With the world’s increasing need for computing and as machine learning has become mainstream, continually innovating at the chip level will be critical to sustainably powering the workloads of the future.
Other (low-carbon product R&D)
The Climate Pledge Fund is a $2 billion venture investment program supporting the development of sustainable technologies and services that will enable Amazon to meet our net zero carbon goal. As of the end of 2022, Amazon had invested in 20 companies across multiple industry sectors since launching this fund in 2020.
Other (Emissions Reduction Activities)
As of the end of 2022, Amazon had announced 401 renewable energy projects across 22 countries, comprising 164 wind farms and solar farms, and 237 rooftop solar projects on Amazon facilities.

Description of product(s) or service(s)
In 2022, most of our devices (e.g. Echo, Fire TV, Fire Tablet, Kindle Paperwhite) launched with the Climate Pledge Friendly label. Many of these carry Carbon Trust’s Reducing CO2 certification, demonstrating a reduction in their carbon emissions year over year. The Amazon Smart Thermostat is the first Amazon device to be ECOLOGO Silver certified— demonstrating products meet standards that can reduce the environmental impact of one or more stages of the product lifecycle.
Since 2021, we’ve launched several Echo, Fire TV, Fire Tablet, Kindle, & more devices and accessories that contain, depending on the item, up to 75% recycled plastic, up to 100% recycled yarn, up to 100% recycled aluminum, and up to 90% recycled magnesium, depending on the product. We also joined ChemFORWARD as a co-design partner. Through this partnership, we’re collaborating with industry peers to proactively identify harmful chemicals and safer alternatives ahead of regulations.
We design our devices with best-in-class reliability models so they are more resilient, last longer, & don’t need to be replaced as often.
In 2020, Amazon became the 1st CE company to commit to addressing the electricity used by our devices through RE development, starting with Echo. By the end of 2022, > 60% of Echo & Fire TV devices in customers’ homes had Low Power Mode. We’re making investments in additional wind and solar farm capacity that, by 2025, will be equal to the energy use of Echo, Fire TV, & Ring devices worldwide.

Please explain
We made significant progress in reducing the carbon intensity of our business activities in 2022, following our investments in large-scale, long-term decarbonization solutions.
We also saw a decrease in the absolute emissions from purchased electricity—a result of our investments in global renewable energy projects that came online in 2022— despite increasing the square footage of our buildings to keep pace with our business growth. Our renewable energy investments made Amazon the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for the third year in a row, and we achieved 90% renewable electricity consumed by Amazon attributable to renewable energy sources, up from 65% in 2020.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Coverage is 100% of suppliers governed by Amazon's Supply Chain Standards. Amazon expects all products sold in the Amazon Store or provided to Amazon to be manufactured or produced in accordance with Amazon’s Supply Chain Standards. We also expect all suppliers of goods and services to Amazon to comply with these standards, even when our standards exceed the requirements of applicable law. The rationale for the coverage of this engagement is based on this expectation of compliance with this supplier code to ensure that the manufacturing of Amazon products does not cause unnecessary environmental harm.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We are committed to sourcing products and services that do not cause unnecessary environmental harm, and work with industry experts on ways to understand the environmental impact of our products.

Impact of engagement, including measures of success
As AWS continues to invest in sustainability across our infrastructure, many of our customers have asked us to help measure the carbon footprint of their AWS workloads—both to understand how moving to AWS reduces their carbon footprint and to report their overall footprint. Our customer carbon footprint tool uses simple visualizations to show customers their historical carbon emissions, evaluate related trends as their use of AWS evolves, estimate emissions avoided by using AWS instead of an on-premises data center, and review forecasted emissions based on their current usage and our planned renewable power procurement.
The forecast shows how customers’ footprints will change as Amazon stays on path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years earlier than the original target of 2030, and drives toward net-zero carbon by 2040.
In addition, historical carbon emissions data is available based on a customer’s AWS use from January 2020 onward. This data includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Scope 1 emissions come directly from a company’s operations, while Scope 2 emissions come from the generation of purchased energy, such as the electricity used to power AWS data centers.
The customer carbon footprint tool uses carbon data that meets the international standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. When signed into the AWS Billing console, customers can view their carbon emissions data by geographical location and by AWS service, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). They can also measure changes in their carbon footprint over time, as they deploy new resources in the cloud. We do not charge a fee for access to customer carbon footprint data.

Amazon’s Direct Efforts to Support the Paris Agreement Goals
We advocate in support of public policy that advances the Paris Agreement by
promoting access to and the expansion of clean energy, sustainable transportation, and
other decarbonizing solutions.
Supporting policy action for climate progress
Amazon and our Climate Pledge partners are making important progress on the path to
achieving net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. We know
we can’t do this alone and believe that the public and private sectors must act together
to tackle the scale of the climate challenge.
Amazon’s overarching policy statement about climate change
Human-induced climate change is real, serious, and action is needed from the public
and private sectors. The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human
activities are contributing to climate-warming trends over the past century, and most
leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this
position. We agree and have created The Climate Pledge—a commitment to reach the
Paris Agreement 10 years early. We are innovating and investing to be net-zero carbon
by 2040 and run on 100% renewable energy by 2025. We are purchasing 100,000 fully
electric delivery vehicles, the largest order ever for electric delivery vehicles, and
investing $100 million in nature-based climate solutions and reforestation projects
around the world to begin removing carbon from the atmosphere now. Our sustainability
website provides comprehensive reporting on our carbon footprint and progress on our
commitments.
Describe the process(es) your organization has in place to ensure that your external engagement activities are consistent with your climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
We engage with authorities at the local, state, national, and international levels to
oversee the seamless operations of our international business through different
legislative demands and compliance requirements. Our Public Policy teams work with a
wide range of policymakers, multilateral organizations, industry associations, coalitions,
and other partners across numerous regulatory and policy issues.
We published a report “Amazon’s Initiatives in Support of the Paris Agreement Goals”
describing the actions we take to mitigate the risks associated with potential
misalignments between our positions and those taken by organizations that we support.
This is primarily a concern when trade associations, coalitions, charities, and 501(c)(4)
social welfare organizations to which we contribute may, in the course of representing
their broad membership, take positions on certain issues that are inconsistent with our
public policy positions and that do not reflect our views. When we identify any material
misalignment of this nature, we make clear to that organization that we do not support
that position and that organization is not lobbying on behalf of Amazon on that issue.
The Company’s Vice President of Public Policy reviews and approves each campaign
contribution made with Company funds or resources to, or in support of, any candidate,
political campaign, political party, political committee, or public official in any country, or
to any other organization for campaign-related purposes, to ensure that it is lawful and
consistent with the Company’s business objectives and public policy priorities. The
Company’s Senior Vice President for Global Corporate Affairs, the Senior Vice
President and General Counsel, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
annually review this U.S. Political Engagement Policy and Statement, related
procedures, and a report on all of the Company’s campaign contributions and lobbying
expenses, including donations made to other organizations that may engage in indirect
lobbying on behalf of the Company.
