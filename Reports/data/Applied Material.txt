(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
 Applied Materials defines substantive financial or strategic impacts as those that could materially and adversely affect Applied Materials’ business, financial performance, continuity of operations, and/or cause reputational harm. Our risk assessment processes allow us to evaluate and prioritize the impact of emerging and ongoing risks, which would be considered substantive based on factors like probability, magnitude, and duration, depending on the scenario. The thresholds used to determine whether an impact is substantive are specific to the risk, scenarios, and time horizons evaluated; thus, generalizations on specific thresholds are difficult to provide. Some quantitative indicators we use to assess whether an impact is substantive include:  

% Change to Applied Materials’ OPEX  
% Change to Applied Materials’ profit margins  
% Revenue gains/losses  
% Change in market share  
Number of days of interrupted R&D or manufacturing  
Number of days/weeks of accelerated/delayed time to market

Description of process
Identification and evaluation of climate-related risks and opportunities occurs at various levels of the business, described below.

Identifying risks and opportunities:
- During 2020-2022 Applied Materials completed its first comprehensive physical and transition risk assessments with the support of Trucost (S&P Global). To identify climate-related risks and opportunities across our value chain, the assessments relied on a blend of internal leadership stakeholder interviews and surveys, and industry benchmarking and research to determine the most relevant physical and transition climate-related risks for Applied Materials and its value chain.

- Applied Materials’ ESG team uses the Datamaran platform to systematically identify and prioritize ESG-related issues (including climate, energy, and renewable energy) most important to its stakeholders. The results were informed through Applied Materials’ internal stakeholder input along with Datamaran’s aggregated research and benchmarking of external stakeholder sources (customer and industry peer reports, regulations, media, etc.)

- Applied Materials’ Business Continuity team works with site-level teams to identify and track location-specific risks, which include environmental and climate-related risks. A templated approach is used to track historical risk-related events that may inform future trends.

Evaluating risks and opportunities:
- Climate-related risk is assessed by company executives relative to other multi-disciplinary company-wide risks in Applied Materials’ enterprise risk management (ERM) annual survey.

- Physical climate risks were modelled for our top 32 global facilities using RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 climate scenarios and CMIP5 models to determine their statistical likelihood and identify risk factors such as wildfires, water stress, and flooding that could impact these locations from 2020-2050. Similar risks were evaluated by interviewing Applied Materials stakeholders considering both our own business operations and the company’s global supply chain.

- Transition risks associated with Applied Materials’ own business and value chain related to potential shifts in future carbon pricing between 2020-2050 were compiled by Trucost using a blend of publicly available carbon pricing data across 100 geographies, low/medium/high price increase scenarios based on existing climate commitments and 2°C pathways and Applied Materials-specific business growth modelling. Interviewed stakeholders also considered policy, market, reputational, and technology-related risks and opportunities and evaluated the likelihood, timeframes in which the risks could occur, and relevance of impacts for our operations and upstream and downstream across our value chain. External research and peer benchmarking were also conducted to evaluate reputational risks and technology-related risks within the semiconductor manufacturing sector.

Responding to climate-related risks:
- Applied Materials has continued to monitor and prepare for potential acute physical climate-related risks on an annual basis, with responsibility for identifying company-wide and site-specific risks resting with a core team of global emergency response, crisis management, and business continuity personnel, as well as local facilities teams. Our risk identification, mitigation, and management plans help ensure our ability to recover quickly from climate-related events and effectively support our customers’ and suppliers’ operations.

Applied Materials has been monitoring certain transitional risks, including new and modified climate change regulations and their potential impact on our business operations, .as well as changes in sources of energy and mandatory disclosure of carbon emissions from our operations. California, the U.S., Europe, UK, and China, are all at the forefront of seeking to mandate climate disclosures. These are all considered in the Applied Materials environmental management system (EMS).

At the asset level, we use the site facilities and business continuity teams to identify local physical risks and concerns to business units and operations. Oftentimes, the ISO 14001 EMS, PSI Behavior Change Framework or Private Sector Preparation, or variations of these frameworks, are used with tool development to identify site specific concerns.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Applied Materials analyzes existing regulations and their impact on the business to guide the development of compliance strategies. For example, to comply with current European Union regulations restricting the importation of hazardous substances, Applied Materials re-designed certain product lines to ensure the products would meet EU importation standards.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
The emergence of, and potential for, regulation is actively being monitored by our legal, government affairs and other teams to determine potential business impacts, where relevant to Applied Materials’ business.

For example, we’ve been monitoring potential future regulatory restrictions on emission-intensive process chemicals that are used in some of our semiconductor tools. This may require process modifications to meet future emissions constraints. Other examples include EPA’s proposed regulation on reducing HFCs, as well as active monitoring of the evolving regulatory space around climate risk disclosures in the EU and by the SEC.

Applied Materials utilizes a third-party regulatory monitoring agency to assess emerging regulations that may impact our operations.
Technology

Company-specific description
Applied Materials’ customers’ chip manufacturing operations are typically both energy and water intensive, and customers are increasingly focusing on improving the efficiency and overall resource consumption of their manufacturing processes and setting ambitious goals to lower their impacts. Over time, customers may also be subject to both cost and regulatory pressures that incentivize them to shift their purchasing preferences towards increasingly more energy and water-efficient equipment. There is a risk of impacts to revenues and market share if Applied Materials is unable to outpace its competitors in offering more efficient equipment that enables customers to meet their business and environmental goals. Applied Materials addresses this risk through its 3x30 goals aimed at achieving a 30% reduction in energy and chemical impact for its semiconductor products on a per-wafer basis by 2030. In addition, Applied Materials is developing solutions such as the iSystemTM controller, EcoTwin software, and Aeris-G abatement system, which are enabling our customers to comprehensively measure and manage the power usage and optimization of our tools and the systems that support them.

C3.3
(C3.3) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your strategy.
Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
As customer preferences shift toward more energy-efficient products, Applied Materials has and continues to develop technologies that allow customers to meet current and future environmental obligations to their own customers, regulators, and other stakeholders. For example, Applied Materials is actively producing technologies to reduce the power consumption of semi-conductor chips and providing more effective abatement solutions. We also produce systems and services to improve the overall energy efficiency of semiconductor fabrication facilities. These strategies are being implemented and monitored in the immediate-to-short-term (1-5 years) and longer term (over the next 10 years).
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
Applied Materials' tier 1 supply chain, consisting of over 3,000 suppliers, is spread across the globe. Given Applied Materials ' supply chain is geographically diverse, well-coordinated and proficient at managing continuity risks, recent impacts of severe weather events, such as typhoons and hurricanes, have been relatively modest. Applied Materials is currently assessing its top (approximately 80% by spend) suppliers on environmental performance via the Responsible Business Association (RBA) self-assessment questionnaire, which has suppliers report on their GHG tracking, goals, and initiatives, as well as a targeted GHG survey. Suppliers considered high risk (evaluated each year) are audited against the framework. This strategy is being implemented and monitored in the immediate-to-short-term (1-5 years) and longer term (over the next 10 years).
Investment in R&D	
Yes
As environmental regulations emerge and evolve in different regions where Applied Materials operates, the company must design products that comply with varying standards to continue serving customers. For example, when the European Union restricted the types of refrigerants that can be imported, Applied Materials invested in R&D to redesign certain products so they would no longer be reliant on the restricted chemicals. These strategies are being implemented and monitored in the immediate-to-short-term (1-5 years) and longer term (over the next 10 years).
Operations	
Yes
As Applied Materials expands its operations to meet growing semiconductor demand, we are integrating climate considerations into the evaluation of new construction and leases, such as access to stable supply of energy and water. For example, we are adjusting energy modeling for our new R&D facilities to ensure we are planning for energy demands in a warming climate and building in water recycling processes.

The absolute target covers 100% of our company-wide Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based emissions in the base year and is currently undergoing validation by SBTi.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Applied Materials has already made progress towards its scope 1 and 2 target in 2022, achieving a 3% reduction from our 2019 baseline year despite record business growth. The biggest factor contributing to this is our scaling of renewable electricity procurement, namely our White Mesa, TX wind VPPA coming online in 2021. Other utility-level procurement of renewables as well as some efficiencies at our facilities are also supporting progress towards our goal. Looking forward, Applied Materials has developed a roadmap to reach its goal of 100% renewable electricity globally, which will be the key lever to achieving our scope 1 and 2 SBT. In addition, measures to enhance efficiency across our buildings, manufacturing sites, and labs are also in the process of being evaluated as well as methods for any new buildings to meet high standards for energy efficient equipment and access to renewable electricity.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
There are two key components to enable the achievement of this target: 1) Reducing the energy and chemical impact of Applied Materials’ products to make them more efficient, and 2) Customers powering our equipment with clean energy. Applied Materials has already established its 3x30 goals and program to make its products more efficient through various means, including improvements in product design, chemical abatement, and optimizing recipes. We are also fortunate that many of our customers already have established renewable energy and Scope 2 emission reduction goals. Applied Materials has engaged key customers to evaluate collaborative opportunities to expand the use of clean energy at fabs and is participating in industry groups such as the SEMI Climate Consortium, CEBA, and RE100 to ensure we’re playing our part to expand clean energy access across our global markets.

Our company provides an industry standard calculation of the energy consumption of our products (using the SEMI S23 standard), allowing our customers to forecast energy use and emissions related to the operation of our equipment. This data allows our company to work with our customers to improve the environmental performance of our products. The Applied Materials iSystem controller is one example of how our products can help our customers reduce energy and resource consumption in their semiconductor manufacturing operations. In today’s semiconductor fab, the focus on saving energy and resources has shifted from facility operations to the subfab, which contains support equipment (pumps, abatement systems, etc.) that can consume around half of the total energy use of the fabrication facility. To reduce energy consumption and conserve natural resources, we offer the Applied Materials iSystem controller, which incorporates a hot standby idle mode in subfab control systems. While monitoring tool operation, the Applied Materials iSystem controller collects valuable data that can be used to generate resource consumption and GHG emissions. Applied Materials has shipped units used to connect more than 5,900 pieces of subfab equipment in customer fabs, thereby supporting customer sustainability initiatives.

Description of product(s) or service(s)
Awareness of global warming is increasing, and the regulatory push to effect GHG emissions reduction is in full swing. Recognizing this, Applied Materials continues to search for proactive, cost-effective ways of reducing the high global-warming potential (GWP) of the gaseous chemicals used when operating our equipment, such as perfluorocarbon compounds (PFCs), NF3 and SF6.

The Applied Materials Aeris-G system is a pre-pump plasma abatement solution that uses less energy by treating the actual process gas volume—a smaller and more concentrated volume than what is treated by post-pump abatement units. The plasma dissociation combined with the low volume of nitrogen in the Aeris-G chamber during abatement minimizes NOx emissions to near zero. The Aeris-G unit operates "on-demand," further reducing operating costs compared to energy-hungry, continuous operation post-pump abatement.

The Aeris-G system can be installed within the pump footprint of each chamber. Ideal for existing tool installations, it easily fits into existing exhaust lines and requires only power, nitrogen, cooling water and ultrapure water connections. For new tool installations, Aeris-G saves subfab space, reduces utility and exhaust connections, and minimizes installation costs while improving abatement efficiency.

Explain your calculation of avoided emissions, including any assumptions
This avoided emissions calculation depends highly on the wafer process application. Aeris-G is typically able to reduce emissions because the system provides destruction removal efficiency (DRE) >95%, typical for CF4, and DRE >99%, typical for SF6, CHF3, C3F8, NF3, C4F8. This calculation is compared to process tools with no abatement (0% DRE) in place.

Percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or value chain partners
0
Please explain
• Based on FY21 and FY22 annual investment value ($) of holding within investee companies
• Calculated using 2018 US EPA EEIO factors with a deflator2 applied to get to equivalent 2021 and 2022 dollars mapped to the relevant investee sector
• The calculation excludes project finance and debt investments; managed investments and client services are not applicable
• Some Scope 3 categories may exclude recent acquisitions that occurred in FY22, which are estimated to have a nominal impact to the overall footprint and will be integrated in the following reporting year.

Taiwan, China
Limited supply of renewable electricity in the market
Prohibitively priced renewable electricity
Taiwan’s renewable energy market is still limited in scale and unable to meet the total demand needs of buyers in the market. What supply comes online is quickly purchased by much larger buyers, making it difficult and costly for more mid-sized companies like ours to participate. Further, market constraints also drive up the prices of what projects are available. Applied Materials has executed its first PPA in Taiwan but covers only a portion of our full load.
Singapore
Lack of electricity market structure supporting bilateral PPAs
Limited supply of renewable electricity in the market
Prohibitively priced renewable electricity
Singapore’s renewable energy supply is extremely limited and constrained by the country’s small physical footprint. Onsite solar seems to be the only viable option for most buyers. Applied Materials is developing further plans for such projects where possible; however, they will not deliver the volume of clean energy required by our operations. The only viable options available are either grid interconnection with neighboring countries or importing green hydrogen, which is still a nascent technology.
Republic of Korea
Lack of credible renewable electricity procurement options (e.g. EACs, Green Tariffs)
Limited supply of renewable electricity in the market
South Korea’s market is similarly constrained, with no PPA/VPPA options available to the best of our knowledge. The centrally managed utility is prohibitive to new developers coming into the market and adding competitive solutions, and it’s unclear how much the utility is doing to develop its own sources of renewable power.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Applied Materials recognizes the climate and energy impact of our value chain. ~15% of our Scope 3 2019 baseline emissions lie in the Purchased Goods and Services category, demonstrating the importance of gathering information and engaging the suppliers associated with this key category of emissions. Applied Materials evaluates material ESG impacts within our supply chain, including climate and energy performance, by assessing the top (approximately 80% of spend) of our suppliers by spend for compliance with the Responsible Business Alliance code of conduct and by assessing their GHG programs with an additional GHG focused survey. Data is collected and analyzed on an annual basis and is augmented with further external research of climate-related goals and metrics using publicly available information.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We have escalated the issue of climate and energy management with suppliers through our enhanced effort to gather this level of performance data from our suppliers covering approximately 80% of spend. Our data collection and communication of our expectation to suppliers that these issues be effectively managed help drive action in parts of the semiconductor supply chain that have not typically been reached. Key measures of success include increasing supplier response rates to the survey by ~10% per year as well as increasing the proportion of responding suppliers each year who are a) tracking and measuring their energy and emissions and b) establishing GHG reduction goals.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Applied Materials’ SuCCESS2030 initiative includes a 10-year roadmap that extends our sustainability vision across our supply chain for semiconductor and display manufacturing. Through this program, Applied Materials communicates its ESG priorities, including climate and energy-related issues, engages and educates suppliers on expectations, and identifies high risk suppliers who are then audited against the framework. In 2022 we hosted a supplier webinar to remind suppliers of our commitment to sustainability and inform them of our expectations of quality data and emission reduction goals. To further incentivize their participation, we introduced our partnership with a third party that will help suppliers calculate Scope 1 and 2 emissions and set reduction targets. This assistance is open to all suppliers, but we have focused on suppliers in the top ~80% of spend.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
The webinar and third-party engagement have enabled suppliers to act on the principles covered in the RBA code of conduct, including the expectation to track, set goals against, and reduce GHG emissions. This is an improvement from our 2021 engagement, which focused on educating a limited group of 20 suppliers. This year we are continuing to help suppliers take meaningful steps to sustainability through training, webinars, and data validation. A key measure of success includes increasing the number of suppliers with quality emissions data and commitments to emissions reduction and renewable energy usage.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
Scope 3 Category 11 covering the use of our semiconductor products in our customer’s facilities is the largest contributor to our Scope 3 emissions, representing nearly 80% of our total GHG footprint. Applied Materials cannot achieve its own Scope 3 reduction goals without engaging our customers. Applied Materials engages its largest customers by sales and emissions to share information on its low-carbon and more efficient product offerings and will collaborate with customers to model energy savings opportunities and implement solutions, such as our iSystem intelligent controller, which enables tracking of resource consumption, emissions, and other environmental factors. We prioritize our largest customers to amplify the impact these products can have in the market, and fortunately these largest customers are also generally the ones that have their own established climate and energy-related goals and initiatives in place, which we can support through hardware and software solutions. Much of our footprint depends on how our customers use our equipment; therefore, close collaboration is needed to support the development of lower impact processes.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
With this design support, our product groups’ responsibilities extend beyond traditional performance attributes to encompass sustainability performance as well—adding new features to our existing portfolio of energy-saving product enhancements, passing on substantial energy saving opportunities to our customers, and modelling sustainability leadership industry-wide—for example, redesigning chillers and chilling processes to reduce energy and water consumption, locating sensors optimally to collect data and inform sustainability improvements, etc. Through such measures we have enabled annual energy use reductions in the tens of millions of kWh per year for our customers, and we expect this trend to continue to increase in the coming years. Key measures of success include maintaining or increasing engagement with customers representing at least 70% of Scope 3 Category 11 emissions, increasing the total number of energy-saving projects implemented per customer per year, and increasing the total annual savings of such projects in terms of kWh and CO2e.

Description of this climate related requirement
Applied Materials expects its suppliers representing approximately 80% of procurement spend to disclose their available climate and energy data as a part of the annual RBA assessment process. Applied Materials uses an environmental survey to capture information on total scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water consumption, waste generation, any goals/targets suppliers have set to improve their performance, and where more information regarding their climate, energy and water programs can be found. In addition, Applied Materials reviews suppliers' publicly available sustainability reports and CDP disclosures to track and validate climate-related data. In 2022, Applied Materials further enforced climate-related requirements through a third party that helps suppliers calculate and validate data.
