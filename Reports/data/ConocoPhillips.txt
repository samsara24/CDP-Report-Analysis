Further details of incentive(s)
All of our employees throughout the world — including our executives — participate in our annual incentive program, called the Variable Cash Incentive Program (“VCIP”). It is our primary vehicle for recognizing company and individual performance for the prior year. We believe that having an annual “at risk” compensation element gives all employees a
financial stake in the achievement of our business objectives and motivates them to use their best efforts to ensure the achievement of those objectives. We also believe that all participating employees can have the opportunity to establish and achieve their specified goals within one year.

For all employees, the base VCIP award is comprised of equally weighted corporate performance categories including 0HSE (20%), Operational (20%), Financial (20%), Strategic and ESG Milestones (20%), and TSR (20%). The HRCC has discretion to adjust base awards up or down depending on individual performance, but the final award, inclusive of any adjustments, may not exceed 200 percent of the target. Beginning with the 2022 program, the HRCC eliminated individual performance adjustments in the short-term incentive program for NEOs.

From (years)	To (years)	Comment
Short-term

Our near-term time horizon is one to five years, during which we can complete short-cycle drilling campaigns and small projects. Our GHG forecasting and financial planning processes are used to determine risks and opportunities that could have a material financial impact for that period. Our near-term climate-related risks are generally government policy-related and managed at the business unit level through policy advocacy and technology to reduce emissions.

Regulations to address climate-related risk, including GHG emissions, are a near-term risk for several of our businesses. For example, regulations issued by the Alberta government under the Emissions Management and Climate Resilience Act require any facility existing in 2016, with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year, to reduce its net emissions intensity, with reduction increases over time. The cost of compliance and investment in emissions intensity reduction technologies influence investment decisions for the Canada business unit, where we are purchasing carbon offsets while evaluating and developing technology opportunities such as CCS and subsurface technology to reduce emissions for existing and new facilities. Good examples of technology developments that decrease GHG emissions intensity are our commercialization of non-condensable gas co-injection at our oil sands operations which improves our steam-to-oil ratios by 20-30%, the deployment of wellbore technology such as flow control devices and multilateral wells which improve steam-to-oil ratios by 10-20%, and the piloting of steam additives which has the potential for a 20% improvement to our steam-to-oil ratio.

GHG emissions costs, or carbon costs, are another near-term risk in some jurisdictions where we operate. For example, in Norway, we are managing carbon cost risk with specific actions to study both operational emissions reduction opportunities as well as technical modification opportunities and evaluate project economics that include the Norwegian carbon fee and European Union CO2 emissions costs (EU ETS).

Another policy area we monitor is related to border carbon adjustments (BCAs). For example, the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) seeks to put a price on carbon for carbon-intensive traded goods.
Medium-term	
6
10
Our medium-term time horizon is six to 10 years, during which we can complete most major projects and revise our portfolio if required. Our GHG forecasting and financial planning processes are used to determine the risks and opportunities that could have a material financial impact for that period. Medium-term risks take longer to impact our business and may include emerging policy that is not yet fully defined. These risks are managed by business unit planning but, if significant, may also be managed by corporate strategies and company-wide risk assessments.

Offset requirements have been identified as both a medium-term risk and as an opportunity for some business units where carbon offsets can be used for compliance with an emissions reduction program.

Climate-related physical changes are a medium-term risk for some of our operations. In Alaska, mitigation measures include pre-packing snow to accelerate the start of the ice road season and engineering and maintaining gravel roads and pads to be protective of underlying permafrost.

Another medium-term risk is access to capital markets. Increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in pressure from and on stockholders, financial institutions and other market participants to modify their relationships with oil and gas companies and to limit or discontinue investments, insurance and funding to such companies. For example, a significant number of financial institutions are now members of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), thereby voluntarily pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 on Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, as well as setting interim targets for 2030 or earlier. While GFANZ members are not prohibited from having relationships with oil and gas companies, the nature of their target commitments may imply that greater restrictions will be placed on GFANZ members in the future. Conversely, we also face pressure from some in the investment community and certain public interest groups to limit the focus on ESG in our decision-making. If public pressure continues to mount, our access to capital on terms we find favorable may be limited, and our costs may increase. Additionally, our reputation could be damaged, and our business and results of operations may be otherwise adversely affected.
Long-term	
11
25
Our long-term time horizon is 11 years and beyond. Generally, long-term risks are managed by our scenario analysis and Climate Risk Strategy, as they include long-term government policy, technology trends and consumer preferences that affect supply and demand. They may also include risks that align with long-term physical climate scenarios.

We recognize that our GHG intensity will be compared against peers, so we track this as a competitive risk at the corporate level. Investors, the financial sector and other stakeholders compare companies based on climate-related performance, and GHG intensity is a key indicator. For this reason, our GHG intensity target aligns with the long-term time horizon to ensure we manage the risk appropriately. It also demonstrates our goal to be a leader in managing climate-related risk.

Both chronic and acute physical climate risks are a long-term risk for our business. In some parts of the U.S., we have identified potential storm severity as a risk for future operations, based on previous storms and flooding. Consensus science suggests that future extreme weather events may become more intense and/or more frequent, thus potentially adding incremental risk to our operations in coastal regions and areas susceptible to typhoons or hurricanes. We have a crisis management system in place to manage that risk before, during and after a storm event.
C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
Our governance structure provides board and management oversight of our risk processes and mitigation plans. Our management system approach to identifying, assessing and managing sustainable development (SD) risks aligns with how we make business decisions to ensure the consistent global identification and assessment of risks. This system links directly to the enterprise risk management (ERM) process, which includes an annual risk review by executive leadership and the board. These elements help us manage and mitigate risk, as well as track our SD performance. 



Assessing and Managing Risks

Our Risk Management Standard mandates a process for operated assets and projects to assess and manage risks to ensure corporate oversight, assurance and consistent implementation. Risks are identified and evaluated against the physical, social and political settings of our operations by subject matter experts in each business unit (BU) and project. Local concerns may influence the potential importance of these environmental and social matters, including cumulative effects. Each risk is then assessed using a matrix that evaluates both its likelihood and consequence. In evaluating the consequence severity, we consider potential impacts on employee and public safety, sociocultural and economic impacts to stakeholders, environmental impacts, and reputational and financial implications. Risks identified as significant or high at the corporate or BU level are included in the corporate SD Risk Register. The company reviews risks annually and updates the SD Risk Register and associated action plans. Regular audits are scheduled in each business unit.



The standard further mandates action plans for mitigating risks ranked significant or high and tracking in the corporate SD Risk Register. Risks that are no longer ranked significant or high due to the effectiveness of mitigation actions, as well as risks that are identified as medium are tracked at the corporate and business unit level.



Action Plans

The SD Risk Management Standard requires an assessment of potential sustainability risks associated with company activities. Significant and high risks are documented in a corporate register with mitigation actions identified. Risks and mitigating actions are assessed at minimum annually by the business units and corporate. The SD Risk Register and action plans are used to guide goal setting and track performance. 



Action plans are managed at the BU level. Overarching risk management actions, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) target setting, prioritization of global emissions abatement projects and disclosure and reporting, are managed at the corporate level.



Enterprise Risk Management

Sustainability risks are integrated into the corporate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system. Risks from the corporate SD Risk Register are mapped to relevant enterprise risks including market, reputational, operational and political. Owners of these enterprise risks, who are ELT members or senior managers, are briefed on the risks and our mitigation activities. Enterprise risks are then presented to the Audit and Finance Committee (AFC) of the board. The AFC receives regular updates on how enterprise risk is being addressed, mitigated and managed across the company. 



Long-Range Plan and Corporate Strategy

Our long-range and strategic planning activities consider risks and mitigation. Our Long-Range Plan (LRP) forecasts key data for our corporate strategy covering our proposed portfolio development and performance, production, costs and cash flows. We also use the LRP to forecast GHG emissions and water management to understand our future environmental footprint. Environmental and social risk mitigations, such as emissions reduction projects, are reflected in the LRP and our annual budget.



Our corporate strategy defines the company’s direction for exploration and development, including portfolio, capital allocation and cost structure. Our cost of supply, portfolio diversification (both geological and geographical) and technology investments are aspects of the corporate strategy that also address sustainability risk. For example, a low cost of supply mitigates climate transition risk in lower-energy demand scenarios. Having a geographically diverse portfolio helps mitigate the risk of community or stakeholder concerns delaying a significant portion of our production. Investing in water treatment technology allows us to recycle produced water and decrease our reliance on local water sources. Investing in local conservation initiatives allows us to mitigate some nature risks and impacts. We work with company leadership through our governance structure, enterprise risk management system and energy transition models to ensure our strategy effectively manages SD risks.

Description of process
We utilize an integrated management system approach to identify, assess, characterize and manage climate-related risks. This system links directly to the enterprise risk management (ERM) process, which includes an annual risk review by the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors.

To understand long-term risk and mitigation options, we utilize four scenarios. This scenario approach helps us evaluate distinct outcomes related to the potential timing and intensity of government climate change policy development, the pace of alternative energy technology development and trends in consumer behavior. This information is then used to shape our analysis and consideration of various outcomes for policy, technology and market risk.

We periodically review emerging climate-related risks with our Executive Leadership Team as part of our scenario monitoring system, managed by our Chief Economist’s Office. A cross-functional team enters events into a centralized database that is reviewed regularly for indications that risks are changing or developing. We use this “early warning” system to inform our strategies in a timely manner so that we can identify and implement effective mitigation measures. The scenario monitoring system helps us understand the pace and direction of the energy transition. For example, if regulations and technology were moving more quickly than in our scenarios, this would indicate that we might be moving to a 1.5-degree scenario similar to the range identified in the IPCC “1.5 degree” report, and we would evaluate appropriate pathways. In our resiliency workshops, we use externally produced scenarios that describe the range of possible future physical risk.

As part of the annual risk management process mandated by our SD Risk Management Standard, we examine operated assets and major projects against the physical, social and political settings of our operations. Subject matter experts in each business unit (BU) and project identify and describe climate-related risks.

Each risk is then assessed using a matrix that evaluates both its likelihood and consequence. Risks rated significant or high are included in the corporate SD Risk Register. In evaluating the consequence level, we consider potential impacts on employee and public safety, sociocultural and economic impacts to stakeholders, environmental impact, and reputational and financial implications.

As part of the process, we examine the interdependence of risks and work to identify emerging risks such as new regulatory requirements and emerging greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing regimes.

Description of process
A climate-related risk assessment is conducted on any future project development that costs more than $50 million net and is expected to emit more than 25,000 metric tons CO2 equivalent (TeCO2e) net to ConocoPhillips during any year of its operational lifespan. This assessment is mandatory for investment approval in our project authorization process. Project teams for qualifying projects are required to assess the potential risks and opportunities associated with GHG emissions, GHG regulation and a physically changing climate based on local jurisdictions and geographies as opposed to relying solely on our corporate scenarios. The climate risk assessment guidelines provide a framework for project teams to:

1. Forecast operational GHG emissions for the life of the project.
2. Evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities, including physical and transition risks that apply to the project.
3. Make decisions on GHG emissions control in project design, including energy efficiency solutions, power source selection, emissions management, carbon capture and storage/utilization, and external compliance options such as the purchase or origination of GHG offsets.
4. Evaluate the potential cost of GHG emissions in project economics.

We assess climate-related risks early in the project engineering stage to better inform our investment decisions and facility design. The ConocoPhillips Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and Social Issues Due Diligence Standard also provides further guidance on accounting for sustainable development issues for new acquisitions, new business ventures, joint ventures and property transactions.

Project Authorization
Our corporate authorization process requires all qualifying projects to include GHG pricing in their project approval economics. The base case for project approval economics now includes the higher of the forecast of existing regulations and the current transition scenario for that jurisdiction. Where there is no GHG price regulation, we use the current transition scenario for that jurisdiction. We also run two sensitivities:

1. With existing carbon pricing regulations, to reflect near-term cash more accurately.
2. With a sensitivity of $60 per tonne CO2e to act as a stress test to reduce the risk of stranded assets should climate regulation accelerate.

This ensures that both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our planning and decision making.

Managing Climate-Related Risks
Our climate-related risk management process is designed to drive appropriate action for adapting to a range of possible future scenarios. Through integrated planning and decision making, we develop mitigation plans for climate-related risk, track performance against our goals and adjust our plans as we learn, and conditions evolve.

Local risks and opportunities related to our operations and projects are assessed and managed at the BU level, enabling tailored business goals to address the challenges and opportunities unique to each region’s operations. Reporting and overarching climate-related risks, such as GHG target-setting and prioritization of global emissions-abatement projects, are managed at the corporate level.

The objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, emissions reduction technologies, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. The strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement.

Integrating Climate-Related Risks into ERM
Climate-related risks from the corporate SD Risk Register are mapped to key categories in the enterprise risk management process (ERM).

The ERM process is a direct input into our strategic planning process. By identifying major cross-cutting risks and trends, we closely link action plan efforts to key performance issues and address and mitigate identified risks. The board regularly reviews the ERM system and mitigation actions.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Current regulation and how it might evolve is considered in our risk assessments through the SD Risk Assessment Standard, Climate Risk Assessment, and our scenario analysis. For example, we consider the impact of current cap and trade programs where we operate, such as the EU ETS, and how the carbon pricing may change. In our scenarios, we consider different magnitudes and speeds of implementation for government actions to view a range of possible futures.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
Emerging regulation is considered in our risk assessments through the SD Risk Assessment Standard, Climate Risk Assessment, and our scenario analysis. For example, we consider the impact of possible future carbon taxes in our projects with a $60/tonne carbon tax sensitivity as more fully described in our response to C11.3a. In our scenarios, we consider different magnitudes and speeds of implementation for government actions to view a range of possible futures.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
Technology is considered in our risk assessments through the SD Risk Assessment Standard, Climate Risk Assessment, Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, and our scenario analysis. For example, we assess technology solutions in our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, which calculates a “breakeven cost of carbon” for each emission reduction project that is evaluated by the Executive Leadership Team. This has included technologies such as Flow Control Devices that are currently being implemented in Canada. In our scenarios, we consider different magnitudes and speeds of implementation for technological advancement to view a range of possible futures.
Legal	
Relevant, always included
Legal risk is considered in our risk assessments through the SD Risk Assessment Standard and Climate Risk Assessment.
Market	
Relevant, always included
Market risk is considered in our risk assessments through our scenario analysis. Our scenarios illustrate a range of demand and supply implications.
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
Reputation is considered in our risk assessments through the SD Risk Assessment Standard and Climate Risk Assessment. For example, we consider that reputation could affect community support and the ability to attract a talented workforce. Reputational impacts are managed through our Stakeholder Engagement Action Plan and investor engagement strategy.

Cost of response to risk
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
Reducing the GHG emissions intensity of our oil sands operations continues to be a priority for our Canada operations. We co-inject non-condensable gas (NCG) with steam to reduce steam requirements and improve thermal efficiency, reduce GHG emissions intensity and enhance incremental oil production at Surmont. This allows for a reduction in the steam-to-oil ratio (SOR) and consequent reduction in GHG emissions intensity. The technology can be applied to almost any steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operation, resulting in GHG intensity reductions of approximately 20-30%. Further, we have installed flow control devices on SAGD producer and injector wells with steam block capabilities to further reduce SOR and reduce shut-in occurrences.

Early project results have been shared with Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) Innovation Plus consortia to encourage widespread deployment of the technology throughout Canada’s oil sands. In response to lower oil prices from the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 and 2021, the BU developed a new co-injection alternative, “NCG Lite,” to allow for the continued injection of NCG during curtailment without the need to install additional infrastructure.

We are also piloting multilateral well technology including innovative drilling and completion methods and thermal junction technology in existing vertical wellbores to increase production from a single surface location. This approach reduces surface footprint and provides increased bitumen production without additional steam injection, thereby reducing GHG emissions intensity and operating costs.

These projects have benefitted from financial support provided through Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA). ERA invests the proceeds from its carbon pricing scheme to reduce GHGs and strengthen the competitiveness of new and incumbent industries and accelerate Alberta’s transformation to a low-carbon economy.

Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon legislation in 2022 were fees of approximately $36 million (net share before-tax). We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our British Columbia and Alberta operations in Canada, totaling approximately $6 million (net share before-tax).

Financial implications depend on factors such as timing, amount, and potential amount of pass-through to consumer or offsets against other taxes or royalty. The estimated financial impact represents a 25% increase in current costs. Because there are numerous factors that could impact our assessments, the estimates are inherently imprecise.

Norway’s carbon tax system and high-tax regime for oil and gas operations helps improve the economics of investing in electrification solutions. The Norway BU is investigating multiple options to achieve partial electrification in our Ekofisk operations, including:

Small-scale local offshore wind development (preliminary concept with two 10-14 MW turbines) to replace gas-powered turbines at Ekofisk, achieving about 60,000 tonnes of CO2 emission reductions per year.

Connection to a possible future offshore wind power hub with subsea power cables connected to shore.

We also evaluate other opportunities using the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve, which calculates a “breakeven cost of carbon” for each emission reduction project that is evaluated by the Executive Leadership Team

Explain why your organization does not have a climate transition plan that aligns with a 1.5°C world and any plans to develop one in the future
An important component of our Climate Risk Strategy is the Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition, first published in our Proxy Statement in 2022. The plan shows how we intend to play a valued role in the energy transition by executing on our Triple Mandate: reliably and responsibly meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition.

First, meeting transition pathway energy demand requires a focus on delivering production that will best compete in any transition scenario. This production will be delivered from resources with a competitive cost of supply and low GHG intensity, as well as diversity by market and asset type. Next, in delivering competitive returns, ConocoPhillips has
been a leader in shifting the exploration and production sector’s value proposition away from one focused on production toward one focused on returns. Finally, to drive
accountability for the emissions that are within our control, we are progressing toward achieving our net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions ambition.

In service of these three objectives, our plan describes how the company will:

Maintain strategic flexibility:
• Build a resilient asset portfolio with a focus on low cost of supply and low GHG intensity to meet transition pathway energy demand.
• Commit to capital discipline through use of a fully burdened cost of supply, including cost of carbon, as the primary basis for capital allocation.
• Track the energy transition through a comprehensive scenario planning process to calibrate and understand alternative energy transition pathways and test the resilience of our corporate strategy to climate risk.

Reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions:
• Set targets for emissions over which we have ownership and control, with an ambition to become a net-zero company for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050.

Address Scope 3 emissions:
• Advocate for a well-designed, economy-wide price on carbon and engage in development of other policy and legislation to address end-use emissions.
• Work with our suppliers for alignment on GHG emissions reductions.
Contribute to an orderly energy transition:
• Build an attractive LNG portfolio.
• Evaluate potential investments in emerging energy transition and low-carbon technologies.

Pre-Pandemic Trends Scenario
This scenario is built on the assumption that trends established from 2010 to 2019 in energy production and consumption continue. Government policies for carbon emissions remain globally uncoordinated. Technologies evolve at a gradual pace and current modes of transportation and power generation remain the lowest cost, most efficient avenues for energy consumption and generation. Carbon taxes are introduced at a moderate rate in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, rising to only $30/tonne of CO2 equivalent (TeCO2e) in 2050. It is assumed that non-OECD countries have not implemented carbon pricing by 2050 in this scenario1. Consequently, fossil fuels continue to deliver roughly 80% of global energy needs in 2050, and energy-related carbon emissions continue to increase.

The global oil market grows by 20% over 2019’s 100 MMB/D level, driven by solid economic growth and a lack of competitive alternatives. Transportation’s share of total oil demand expands from ~60% today to 65% in 2050. The automotive sector continues to evolve gradually, and the global share of electric vehicle sales increases from 1-2% today to 20% in 2050. The global average internal combustion engine efficiency modestly improves by around 15%, and petroleum remains the most prevalent fuel for all modes of transportation. Production from all regions and resource types is developed.

The natural gas market expands at a faster rate than oil over the long term. By 2050, natural gas demand is ~75% larger (2021), reaching just under 700 billion cubic feet per day (BCF/D) as growing economies utilize more natural gas. The volume of natural gas consumed in power demand more than doubles by 2050. The focal point of global demand shifts away from North America and Europe to Asia and the Middle East.
Transition scenarios	Customized publicly available transition scenario
Company-wide
Unknown
Moderate Transition Scenario
This scenario assumes moderate advances in national level carbon pricing policies and alternative energy technologies, with incremental shifts in consumer preferences for low-carbon products. Fossil fuels remain at roughly 81% of the primary energy mix in 2050. Carbon taxes go into effect across OECD countries during the mid-2020s and are $25/TeCO2 e in 2030, rising to $60 in 2050. It is assumed that China implements its proposed national carbon pricing policy at 50% of the OECD carbon fee and that no other non-OECD country implements a carbon pricing policy prior to 2050. Global energy-related carbon emissions stabilize by 2050.

Global oil demand plateaus in the late 2030’s at around 110 MMB/D and then declines very slowly. Average internal combustion engine efficiency improves by one-third. Electric vehicle penetration is slow in the early years but accelerates in the 2030s and 2040s, reaching 30% of the passenger auto fleet in 2050 (compared to 1% in 2021). Regional policies also influence the outcome for electrification in transportation. Global oil production benefits from technology advances which improve productivity and enable global demand to be satisfied. U.S. crude oil production grows through 2030 then falls as incremental productivity improvements slow and high-quality acreage is exhausted. Russia and OPEC grow to take a larger share of global supply which increases geopolitical risk to supply.

By 2050, the global gas market expands by 40% from 2021 levels. The primary driver for natural gas demand growth is power generation. Natural gas consumed in power generation increases from 155 BCF/D in 2021 to 240 in 2050. Improvements in energy storage enable wind and solar to be available throughout the day, increasing their contribution to power generation. Global demand shifts east to Asia and the Middle East. Global supplies remain heavily weighted to North America. U.S. shale gas and Permian associated gas drive North American growth until the 2030s, after which Canada leads North America’s production growth.

Hydrogen and Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) move to become viable, standalone business lines. Moderate progression toward national net-zero targets increases availability of capital funding which paves the way for these technologies to take hold. CCUS grows to 2.1 gigatonnes captured in 2050, while the total hydrogen market expands to 250 million metric tons in 2050.
Transition scenarios	Customized publicly available transition scenario
Company-wide
Unknown
Accelerated Transition Scenario
This is a scenario with more aggressive changes in technologies, consumer preferences and government policies relative to Moderate Transition. Technology is vital to limiting growth in energy demand as the global population and economy expand. Social trends that are prevalent today in specific regions or municipalities spread because technological advances make these choices universally economic. For example, individual auto ownership gives way to shared mobility. Mass transit and ridesharing are accessible and cost effective for more people in more regions. Consumers shift purchases toward products and services with lower carbon footprints, and society demands more transparent environmental stewardship from businesses they patronize. Governments target aggressive policies toward GHG emissions, fossil fuel production and consumption. Economy-wide carbon pricing goes into effect across OECD countries during the mid-2020s and is $30 per TeCO2e in 2030, rising to $80 in 2050. Again, China implements an economy-wide carbon pricing policy at 50% of the OECD price. Other non-OECD countries impose a very low $5 per TeCO2e price by 2030.

The global oil market peaks in size by 2028 and remains near that level until tapering more quickly after 2035. The combination of internal combustion engine efficiencies and faster adoption of electric vehicles, which reach a 40% share of the passenger vehicle fleet by 2050, reduces oil demand in the transportation sector. Oil demand from the industrial sector grows for plastics and chemicals.

The global natural gas market grows at an average annual rate of 0.6% into the 2040s, peaking near 450 BCF/D in 2045 and slowly declining thereafter. Natural gas remains a prominent fuel in electricity generation but starts to yield market share to wind and solar as energy storage technology allows renewables to contribute a larger share of power generation. North America’s gas production increases 15% over today’s level, plateauing in about 2040 before declining.

Faster progression toward net-zero targets and higher carbon prices increase capital available to new technologies, with hydrogen and CCUS remaining the frontrunners. Captured carbon increases to 3.4 gigatonnes by 2050, and advances in renewables-powered hydrogen technology expand the hydrogen market to around 300 million metric tons.
Transition scenarios	Customized publicly available transition scenario
Company-wide
1.5ºC
1.5 Net Zero Scenario
This scenario assumes technology breakthroughs, rapid global policy coordination to price GHG emissions at a level that reduces fossil fuel use and emissions and shifts in consumer preferences towards lower GHG products. OECD countries and China implement a transparent economy-wide carbon price2 mechanism by 2025 which rises from $50/TeCO2e in 2030 to $190 by 2050. Other non-OECD nations follow by imposing economy-wide carbon prices of $10/TeCO2e in 2030 rising to $50 by 2050. Significant technological advances reduce battery, wind and solar generation costs, improve fuel efficiencies for internal combustion engines (80% more fuel efficient by 2050), improve energy efficiency in buildings and lighting, and impact energy production, delivery and consumption. Technology and efficiencies allow total energy demand in 2050 to be only about 2% below 2021’s level with about 70% provided by non-fossil fuels.

Global oil demand peaks in 2023 and declines to 40 MMBD in 2050. Storage improvements lead to EVs achieving parity with internal combustion engine vehicles by the mid-2020s, thus incentivizing consumers to purchase EVs. 70% of the passenger automobile fleet is electric in 2050, transportation sector demand falls to 25% of total oil demand. Oil supply dynamics evolve as most production occurs in OPEC countries and Russia, and geopolitics play an even larger role.

Natural gas market is more resilient in this scenario in comparison to oil as natural gas is needed as a lower-carbon fuel for reliable, dispatchable electricity generation. Global natural gas demand peaks in 2030. Natural gas generates only 4% of global electricity in 2050, wind and solar grow to produce 73% of electricity in 2050. Global gas demand shifts to markets in Asia, the Middle East, CIS and Africa. Only 26% of global gas demand remains in North America and Europe.

Countries and companies push for accelerated progression along net-zero pathways and implement supportive policies along with capital funding to progress new technologies. Hydrogen remains a front-runner, with blue (using CCS) and green hydrogen supporting increased petrochemical and industrial activities. Electrolysis costs fall sharply. Green hydrogen accelerates along with other new technologies, pushing out blue and grey hydrogen production. Hydrogen market grows to around 400 million metric tons in 2050. CCUS plays a critical role in emissions reduction, expanding to 7.0 gigatonnes by 2050.

Row 1
Focal questions
What are the main factors that drive future development and that should be consider as part of the Company's strategic decision making process ?
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
The scenarios we have developed describe possible pathways leading to a particular outcome. Scenarios are hypothetical constructs and are not predictions or forecasts of what we think is going to happen; they are used to illustrate which factors drive future developments. We use scenarios in our strategic planning process to:

Gain better understanding of external factors that impact our business to assist in the identification of major risks and opportunities and inform mitigating actions.
Identify leading indicators and trends.
Test the robustness of our strategy across different business environments.
Communicate risks appropriately.
Inform how we position our business, as technologies and markets evolve, to capitalize on opportunities that meet risk and return criteria.
Using scenarios enables us to understand a range of risks around potential commodity market prices associated with various GHG emissions reduction scenarios. To assist our capital allocation decisions, we can test our current portfolio of assets and investment opportunities against these future possibilities and identify where strengths and weaknesses may exist.

We use a range of analyses, input and information when developing our strategy. The detail of our scenarios gives insight into the analysis we use to inform our strategic decision making and reinforces to stakeholders and shareholders that we are both preparing for reductions in GHG emissions consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement and developing resilient strategies that reflect the complex and uncertain range of energy futures.

We use four main energy transition scenarios in our global energy model: Pre-Pandemic Trend, Moderate Transition, Accelerated Transition and 1.5 Net Zero. The four scenarios incorporate a wide range of possible outcomes for energy and carbon emissions.

While these scenarios extend to 2050, well beyond our near-term operational planning period, they give insights on trends that could have an implication for near- and medium-term decisions and enable choices on the creation or preservation of future options.

Each scenario models the full energy system including coal, oil, natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear, as well as their related GHG emissions and pricing policies. Each of these plausible pathways is designed to stretch our thinking about potential rates of new technology adoption, policy development and consumer behavior.

The scenarios describe four pathways out of the myriad that are possible, given the uncertainty surrounding the development of future energy markets out to 2050. They do not describe all possible future outcomes and are not used as a reliable indicator of the actual impact of climate change on ConocoPhillips’ portfolio or business.

Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
Compliance with policy changes that create a GHG tax, fee, emissions trading scheme or GHG reductions could significantly increase product costs for consumers and reduce demand for natural gas- and oil-derived products. Demand could also be eroded by conservation plans and efforts undertaken in response to global climate-related risk, including plans developed in connection with the Paris Agreement. Many governments also provide, or may in the future provide, tax advantages and other subsidies to support the use and development of alternative energy technologies that could impact demand for our products. However, there are also opportunities associated with increased demand for lower-carbon energy sources such as natural gas to displace coal in power generation and in combination with carbon capture and storage in the production of hydrogen for industrial use.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
We engage with suppliers on the environmental and social aspects of their operations throughout the procurement process. This includes communicating our expectations and priorities and identifying opportunities for improvement and collaboration related to climate issues, including energy use, GHG management and environmental supply chain risks.

We continue to monitor climate-related risks and opportunities related to our supply chain and value chain and believe that maintaining a global network of businesses and suppliers will mitigate physical climate-related risks.

We also recognize the importance of Scope 3 emissions generated by our suppliers in the upstream value chain. Therefore, we have ongoing engagements with major suppliers for alignment of their GHG emissions goals with our plans for the energy transition, and we have incorporated an assessment of their emissions into targeted supplier evaluations. We utilize a sustainability questionnaire in key bids that includes questions on supplier GHG emissions and their own Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets.

We plan to make additional inroads in reducing Scope 3 emissions from those sources that we may be able to influence within our supply chain through continued supplier engagement as part of our Scope 3 Supplier Emissions Strategy. In 2022, we developed a plan for implementation in 2023 to ensure that key elements of our supply chain are evaluated for climate risk, including:

Identifying suppliers with high relative impact on Scope 3 upstream supplier emissions.
Promoting alignment of suppliers’ GHG targets with our net-zero ambition.
Building a governance framework for supplier sustainability to include Scope 3 supplier emissions.
Updating our Supplier Expectations to highlight climate, biodiversity, responsible use of natural resources and human rights. We will revise and implement this documentation through a structured plan to systematically engage with suppliers on sustainability issues throughout the year.
Collaborating with suppliers in conjunction with industry partners like API and Ipieca to align on disclosure frameworks and systems for collecting and reporting supplier emissions.
We plan to provide guidance to key internal stakeholders on how and when to include emissions impact in supplier bids.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
Technology will play a major role in addressing GHG emissions, whether through reducing emissions or lowering the energy intensity of our operations or value chain. As discussed in our External Collaboration and Engagement and Public Policy sections, we participate in a number of research and industry initiatives, two of which are the Natural Gas Initiative and Oil Sands Pathways to Net-Zero Alliance. The Natural Gas Initiative is a program led by Stanford University researchers with participation from industry, government, inter-governmental organizations and foundations. The initiative aims to increase public access to information about the accuracy of methane detection and quantification technologies.

In 2022, ConocoPhillips joined the Oil Sands Pathways to Net-Zero Alliance, which includes Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy. Together this group represents the companies operating approximately 95% of Canada’s oil sands production. The goal of the alliance is to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from oil sands operations by 2050 to help Canada meet its climate goals, including the country’s Paris Agreement commitments and 2050 net-zero aspirations, with the help of CCS. ConocoPhillips is partnering with governments and the founding members of the Alliance to accelerate emissions reduction efforts.

Another way we support technology development is through our annual marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) process. The MACC process identifies and prioritizes our emissions reduction opportunities from operations based on the project’s breakeven cost. This data helps identify projects that might become viable in the future through further research, development and deployment. As a result of this work, we have focused our near-term technology investments on reducing both costs and emissions where feasible, such as improving the steam-to-oil ratio in the oil sands. Part of a new research and development effort is a multilateral well technology pilot, which enables the drilling of multiple lateral sections without the need for additional aboveground capital or additional steam injection, thereby reducing emissions intensity and operating costs.

Over the past five years we have spent more than $550 million on research and development, equipment, products and services which have reduced our GHG emissions.
Operations	
Yes
While our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate a range of potential climate conditions, significant changes, such as more frequent severe weather in the markets we serve or the areas where our assets are located, could cause increased expenses and impact to our operations. The costs associated with interrupted operations will depend on the duration and severity of any physical event and the damage and remedial work to be carried out. Financial implications could include business interruption, damage or loss of production uptime and delayed access to resources and markets. For example, a three-day shutdown of all U.S. Gulf Coast production would result in approximately 660 MBOE of lost production. It is unlikely all our Gulf Coast area production would be affected, as our operations are located across a wide span of the coast.

Business-resiliency planning is a process that helps us prepare to mitigate potential physical risks of a changing climate in a cost-effective manner.

Strategic Planning
A robust and flexible corporate strategy is key to addressing climate-related risks and navigating the energy transition. Some key climate-related components of an exploration and production company’s strategy are portfolio management, including portfolio resilience and diversification, focus on low cost of supply and capital allocation, carbon pricing, and investment in new technology through research and development.

Acquisitions and Divestments
Business development decisions consider possible financial, operational and sustainability impacts to our portfolio. In our long-range planning process, we run sensitivities on our GHG emissions intensity based on possible acquisitions, divestments and project decisions. We focus on cost of supply to account for lower and more volatile product prices and possible introduction of carbon taxes. In recent years, we have divested higher emissions intensity gas fields.

Resilient Portfolio
Our ability to address climate-related risks and meet transition pathway demand will depend on our ability to deliver competitive returns on and of capital. We work to continually improve the underlying cost of supply of our portfolio, with a commitment to return more than 30% of cash from operations to stockholders through the cycles. Our sector-leading approach focuses on the cost of supply of our portfolio, committing to balance sheet strength and moderating growth by holding to disciplined reinvestment rates.

We have communicated to stakeholders a 10-year strategic plan intended to generate double-digit returns on capital employed that are competitive with the top quartile of the S&P 500. We returned $15 billion of capital for 2022, which represented over 50% of our cash from operations, well in excess of our greater than 30% annual commitment.

Oil and natural gas are projected to remain essential parts of the energy supply mix in coming decades across a broad range of transition scenarios. ConocoPhillips intends to maintain its key market role through competitive returns that are resilient to transition-related risks. We focus on remaining resilient and competitive in any scenario by providing low-cost, low-GHG intensity barrels by asset type with continuously improving sustainability performance.

Portfolio Diversification
The mix and location of the resources in our portfolio provide flexibility and adaptability as we monitor scenarios and global trends. Our short-cycle project times and capital flexibility enable us to redirect capital to the most competitive basins. Our extensive low cost of supply resource base allows us to divest higher cost assets to high-grade our portfolio as our strategy evolves. This applies to both hydrocarbon mix and geographic region. If policy in a country or region significantly impacts cost of supply, we can shift capital to other opportunities.

One example of portfolio diversification is the significant expansion of our LNG portfolio in recent years through our increased interest in APLNG and participation in joint ventures with QatarEnergy, as described in the Liquefied Natural Gas section. These projects have a low cost of supply and low GHG emissions intensity on a lifecycle basis and align with our view that LNG is expected to play an increasingly important role in helping meet energy transition pathway demand, with its lower GHG intensity compared to burning coal for power generation.

ConocoPhillips has long been a participant in the LNG business, utilizing our commercial capabilities to develop and supply markets. We believe that U.S. LNG is well placed to provide lower emissions intensity, reliable energy to European and Asian markets. Our U.S. Gulf LNG partnerships also allow for optionality for future offtake from expansion trains and
access to excess cargos from equity investments.

Cost of Supply and Capital Allocation
Cost of supply is the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) equivalent price that generates 10% after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. In our definition, cost of supply is fully burdened with capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, price-related inflation, G&A and carbon tax (if currently assessed). If no carbon tax exists for the asset, carbon pricing aligned with internal energy scenarios is applied. Cost of supply is the primary metric that we use for capital allocation, and it has the advantage of being independent of price forecasts. Any oil price above the cost of supply will generate an after-tax fully burdened return that is greater than 10%. Providing low cost of supply also addresses a key component of a just transition — reliable and affordable energy supply.

The cost of supply of our resource base supports our assertion that resources with the lowest cost of supply are most likely to be developed in scenarios with lower demand, such as the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions Scenario. In 2023, we have a resource base of ~20 billion barrels of oil equivalent with $40 per barrel (or lower) cost of supply and an average cost of supply of $32 per barrel.

To assist our capital allocation decisions, we test our current portfolio of assets and investment opportunities against future possibilities and identify strengths and weaknesses that may exist. As a result of our strategy and scenario work, we have focused capital on resources with low cost of supply, exiting deep water and high emissions intensity gas fields while increasing our investments in unconventional oil projects.

In recent years we have dramatically high-graded our portfolio and applied stringent capital allocation criteria that direct investments to resources that will best match transition demand. We are equally focused on developing assets that have a low cost of supply and low GHG intensity, as these are most likely to compete in any future energy transition pathway with each asset type contributing to its unique market (e.g., unconventionals, LNG, oil sands). Based on our current forecasts, our GHG intensity will improve over time and assets with less than 10 kg CO2e/BOE are projected to represent a larger portion of our portfolio by 2030.

Carbon Asset Risk
Scenario analysis and our Climate Risk Strategy help build optionality into our strategic plans to reduce the risk of stranded assets. Key elements of our climate-related risk management process include:

Considering a range of possible future carbon-constraint scenarios.
Developing strategic alternatives to manage shareholder value in a future with uncertain carbon constraints.
Testing strategies and asset portfolios in various scenarios.
Incorporating risk mitigation actions into the Long-Range Plan and Climate Change Action Plan.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
In April 2023, we strengthened our target to 50-60% reduction by 2030 from a 2016 baseline. The target covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 gross operated and net equity emissions. Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and emissions intensity calculations directly measure our performance and help us understand climate-related risk. Lower intensity assets are more resilient to policy, legal, technology and market risk.

The company has already progressed toward meeting this target over the past several years. Between 2016 and 2022, we achieved a 41% intensity reduction on a target-related, gross operated basis through a combination of specific emissions reduction projects and portfolio changes. Continued capital allocation actions are expected to have a combined impact of lowering GHG emissions intensity by roughly 9-19% as we increase production from assets with low intensity, such as those in the Permian Basin, and achieve reductions from near-term projects.

The target includes emissions that are related to production and excludes emissions from our aviation and polar tankers fleets. This may give rise to small differences between the intensity we report for our GHG target purposes and the intensity we report for our annual metrics. Over the past five years, this difference has been less than 2%, or 1 kg CO2e/BOE.

In 2022, our total gross operated GHG emissions were approximately 16.0 million tonnes, a 14% reduction compared to 2021. The disposition of our Indonesia asset and some smaller Permian dispositions contributed to a decrease in absolute emissions in 2022. In addition, we implemented various emission reduction measures across our assets during 2022, including reductions in flaring and installation of drill site fuel meters.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
GHG emissions management is an expected core competency for our business units (BUs) managing oil and gas production. Those BUs are required to review their GHG emissions profile and identify opportunities to make design and operating improvements that can reduce emissions. Potential GHG emissions reduction projects are reviewed within our annual budget planning process and assessed against pre-determined selection criteria, including cost per tonne of CO2e abated. We call this annual exercise our marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) process.

Addressing the energy transition is one of the most important issues for our company. ConocoPhillips intends to play a valued role in the energy transition by executing three objectives: meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and achieving our net-zero emissions ambition. We call this the Triple Mandate, and it represents our commitment to create long-term value for our stakeholders.

We were the first U.S.-based oil and gas company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate-risk strategy with an ambition to become a net-zero company for operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 2050.

Operational Net-Zero Roadmap
The company’s net-zero roadmap details near- and medium-term Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction efforts by identifying and prioritizing viable abatement options. It also conceptualizes how we intend to fulfil our longer-term targets through planning, fostering technological advancements and partnering with peers and external stakeholders to explore pilot projects that could abate challenging operational emissions.

The company’s net-zero roadmap, like our scenario planning, is a tool that describes a possible pathway leading to a particular outcome. It is intended to be an illustrative example of how we intend to reach our net-zero operational emissions ambition. It is an evergreen construct that will necessarily adjust over time in connection with various factors (including ongoing efforts and results, regulatory and/or technology changes, and future long-term plans that are subject to adjustment).

To drive accountability for the emissions that are within our control, each of our operating business units (BUs) is developing a roadmap to describe its strategies and plans to help drive the company toward realizing our net-zero ambition for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. BUs will also identify technology solutions for hard-to-abate emissions and pilot new methods to reduce and accelerate emissions reductions. When rolled up, these BU roadmaps will inform our technology development, operations and engineering teams, along with our development staff, where to direct efforts today, while allowing us to forecast and prioritize needs of the future.

The company-wide net-zero roadmap will also:

Empower each BU to progress initiatives specific to its needs.
Leverage the marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) process to assess viability and prioritize projects.
Promote collaboration between BUs on projects which are scalable or transferable.
Create new lower-emissions facility designs.
Prioritize pilot projects and tests of emerging technologies to address our most significant needs.
Enhance the tools and processes we use to prioritize, execute and track our emissions reduction efforts.

Our methane emissions reductions come from voluntary reduction activities and from portfolio changes. Our absolute methane emissions decreased in 2022 due to the disposition of our Indonesian and non-core Lower 48 assets, reduced flare volumes, improved detection of fugitive emissions and data quality improvements.

In 2022, methane emissions totaled 1.7 million tonnes of CO2e and constituted approximately 11% of our total GHG emissions.

By year-end 2021, we achieved a 13% reduction of intensity from 2019, surpassing our 2025 target four years early with an intensity of 2.6 kg CO2e/BOE. As of year-end 2022, we have achieved an approximate 70% methane emissions intensity reduction from 2015 with an intensity of 2.5 kg CO2e/BOE.

Reducing methane emissions, even the small equipment leaks known as fugitive emissions, is a key part of our operations. Leak detection and repair (LDAR) is a work practice used to identify and repair leaking components, including valves, compressors, pumps, tanks and connectors, in order to reduce GHG emissions and increase efficiency. We fix leaks as soon as feasible, with many leaks repaired either the same day or within a few days of being detected. We have been voluntarily conducting pilots of new technologies at numerous facilities to determine effectiveness and scalability of next-generation detection technologies. This has included a wide range of ground-based and aerial technologies, each providing different strengths for different monitoring applications. The main objective with these technology pilots is to expeditiously identify, investigate and repair leaks associated with malfunctions and abnormal operating conditions, resulting in faster emissions mitigation. We continue to work with technology providers to develop and test technologies, and we expect improvements over time.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
Routine flaring is defined as flaring of associated gas that occurs during the normal production of oil in the absence of sufficient facilities to utilize the gas onsite, dispatch it to a market or re-inject it. Flaring for safety reasons, non-routine flaring or flaring gas other than associated gas is not included as part of the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring Initiative.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
ConocoPhillips is committed to the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative, a program that aims to create consistency among governments, the oil and gas sector and development institutions to address flaring. In 2022, based on our flaring reductions to date, we committed to achieving zero routine flaring by 2025, five years in advance of the World Bank goal, and we continue to make strong progress. In 2022, routine flaring decreased nearly 90% compared to 2021 through active well management to shut in wells during capacity constraint events. Other projects focus on treatment of sour gas, flare capture and de-bottlenecking. Achieving this target is a key near-term action to achieving our World Bank goal as well as our net-zero operational emissions ambition.

While flaring emissions make up only about 10% of our total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, the target will drive continued near-term focus on routine flaring reductions across our assets.

In 2022, the total volume of flared gas was 17.9 BCF, a decrease of 13% from 2021. The decrease was a result of decreased flaring in Eagle Ford, Norway and Alaska as well as the disposition of our Indonesia asset. In Eagle Ford, decreased flaring was attributable to flare decommissioning, better accounting of flare outage periods, and use of wellsite fuel meters. In addition to reduced flare volumes, flaring intensity also decreased 12%.

Having made significant progress in addressing routine flaring, our future focus will shift to non-routine and safety flaring. These sources of flaring present economic challenges due to the dispersed nature of the assets. We will continue to review viable options to reduce these sources.

Low-Carbon Emitting Products: In 2022, we supplied Asian markets with approximately 0.36 trillion cubic feet (or nearly 1 billion cubic feet per day) of natural gas and LNG. To put this in perspective, if all the natural gas and LNG we sold to Asia in 2022 had been used to replace coal for electricity generation, GHG emissions would have been reduced by approximately 22 million metric tonnes, almost 1.5 times more than the company’s combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for the year, based on EPA GHG emissions factors.

C-OG4.6
(C-OG4.6) Describe your organization’s efforts to reduce methane emissions from your activities.
 Our methane emissions reductions come from voluntary reduction activities and from portfolio changes. Our absolute methane emissions decreased in 2022 due to the disposition of our Indonesian and non-core Lower 48 assets, reduced flare volumes, improved detection of fugitive emissions and data quality improvements. 



In 2022, methane emissions totaled 1.7 million tonnes of CO2e and constituted approximately 11% of our total GHG emissions. 



 By year-end 2021, we achieved a 13% reduction of intensity from 2019, surpassing our 2025 target four years early with an intensity of 2.6 kg CO2e/BOE. As of year-end 2022, we have achieved an approximate 70% methane emissions intensity reduction from 2015 with an intensity of 2.5 kg CO2e/BOE .



Reducing methane emissions, even the small equipment leaks known as fugitive emissions, is a key part of our operations. Leak detection and repair (LDAR) is a work practice used to identify and repair leaking components, including valves, compressors, pumps, tanks and connectors, in order to reduce GHG emissions and increase efficiency. We fix leaks as soon as feasible, with many leaks repaired either the same day or within a few days of being detected. We have been voluntarily conducting pilots of new technologies at numerous facilities to determine effectiveness and scalability of next-generation detection technologies. This has included a wide range of ground-based and aerial technologies, each providing different strengths for different monitoring applications. The main objective with these technology pilots is to expeditiously identify, investigate and repair leaks associated with malfunctions and abnormal operating conditions, resulting in faster emissions mitigation. We continue to work with technology providers to develop and test technologies, and we expect improvements over time. 

C-OG4.7
(C-OG4.7) Does your organization conduct leak detection and repair (LDAR) or use other methods to find and fix fugitive methane emissions from oil and gas production activities?
Yes
C-OG4.7a
(C-OG4.7a) Describe the protocol through which methane leak detection and repair or other leak detection methods, are conducted for oil and gas production activities, including predominant frequency of inspections, estimates of assets covered, and methodologies employed.
 Methane Detection in U.S. Operations 

ConocoPhillips utilizes a variety of leak detection and repair (LDAR) tools to identify and repair methane leaks. First, we conduct LDAR surveys as required by NSPS Subpart OOOOa and other state regulatory frameworks. Second, we utilize various innovative technologies that go above and beyond those required by regulations. These innovative technologies are deployed at selected assets with the intent of evaluating and understanding their limitations and advantages. In addition, ConocoPhillips participates in a variety of voluntary LDAR programs offered through industry organizations, trade associations and joint partnerships. Examples of technologies currently in use are summarized below.   

Informal Inspections
ConocoPhillips personnel visit sites as part of their routine duties or in response to operational issues at the sites. They identify anomalous operating conditions that may contribute to audio, visual or olfactory (AVO) indications of potential leaks. We conduct formal AVO inspections to identify potential leaks at sites where regulatorily required. On most other sites where not regulatorily required, we perform these inspections periodically on a voluntary basis.   

Instrument-based Method 21 Inspections 
Where required by regulatory programs, we conduct LDAR inspections pursuant to requirements of U.S. EPA Reference Method 21, using an organic vapor analyzer.   

Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) Camera Inspections 
We perform periodic inspections at sites using OGI cameras where required by NSPS OOOOa regulations. In addition, at sites not subject to NSPS OOOOa regulations, we conduct periodic OGI inspections on a voluntary basis. In addition to the above LDAR methods either required by or based on regulatory requirements, ConocoPhillips continues to pilot and utilize innovative methods of monitoring, including some airborne and ground-based systems. The pilot programs and deployments of innovative technologies discussed below are not used for regulatory purposes. 

Airborne Systems 
We have piloted several aerial technologies that enable routine monitoring over a larger area and allow for inspection of multiple facilities at a time. Airborne systems are an established way of screening emissions from an entire facility, a group of facilities or a wider geographic area. 

Drone-mounted technology has proven effective in detecting and locating the source of leaks due to their low-altitude capabilities. We have also utilized airplanes and helicopters with mounted sensors to fly over facilities to detect leaks. If leaks are suspected, operations personnel follow up to verify and repair. Airplane sensors can detect smaller leaks, but our experience indicates that their effectiveness at pinpointing exact locations can be diminished in areas where other facilities are in close proximity. ConocoPhillips has worked with Scientific Aviation and Bridger Photonics to fly fixed-wing aircraft carrying detection technology over our Lower 48 assets. We have also contracted with LeakScout to periodically fly helicopters equipped with OGI cameras around select sites. This program has also proven effective in identifying leaks. 

While many of these airborne technologies are good at detecting leaks, they do require personnel following up with hand-held OGI cameras to identify the exact location of the leaks and the equipment involved, after which we conduct repairs and ensure mitigation was successful. 

Satellite-based detection technology is another large-scale leak detection option. However, it has limitations in areas where facilities are located within close to proximity to one another. An additional drawback has been the inability to identify small to medium leaks. Recently launched satellites are showing promise to provide better imaging and allowing more frequent monitoring of specific facilities. ConocoPhillips continues to evaluate how satellite detection may factor into our programs moving forward. For example, we are joining a beta testing program for Environmental Defense Fund's MethaneAir, a precursor to MethaneSat, their satellite to be launched next year using the same detection technology. 

Continuous Monitoring Systems:  Metal Oxide-based SOOFIE Sensors 
ConocoPhillips has implemented systems to monitor for leaks on a continuous basis. We have worked with Scientific Aviation and Qube Technologies, and other vendors, to test continuous methane monitoring devices at select Lower 48 facilities to further enhance early detection and response capabilities. Metal oxide-based sensors are a relatively simple and cost-effective technology that incorporates three to six sensors strategically placed around locations to maximize effectiveness during varying wind conditions. Elevated methane concentrations detected by the sensors are analyzed by an automated system that considers details such as equipment location, distance, wind speed and direction to identify the most probable emissions source. 
C-OG4.8
(C-OG4.8) If flaring is relevant to your oil and gas production activities, describe your organization’s efforts to reduce flaring, including any flaring reduction targets.
ConocoPhillips is committed to the World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative, a program that aims to create consistency among governments, the oil and gas sector and development institutions to address flaring.2 In 2022, based on our flaring reductions to date, we committed to achieving zero routine flaring by 2025, five years in advance of the World Bank goal, and we continue to make strong progress. In 2022, routine flaring decreased nearly 90% compared to 2021 through active well management to shut in wells during capacity constraint events. Other projects focus on treatment of sour gas, flare capture and de-bottlenecking. Achieving this target is a key near-term action to achieving our World Bank goal as well as our net-zero operational emissions ambition.  



While flaring emissions make up only about 10% of our total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, the target will drive continued near-term focus on routine flaring reductions across our assets.  



In 2022, the total volume of flared gas was 17.9 BCF, a decrease of 13% from 2021. The decrease was a result of decreased flaring in Eagle Ford, Norway and Alaska as well as the disposition of our Indonesia asset. In Eagle Ford, decreased flaring was attributable to flare decommissioning, better accounting of flare outage periods, and use of wellsite fuel meters. In addition to reduced flare volumes, flaring intensity also decreased 12%.  



Having made significant progress in addressing routine flaring, our future focus will shift to non-routine and safety flaring. These sources of flaring present economic challenges due to the dispersed nature of the assets. We will continue to review viable options to reduce these sources.

In February 2022, we completed the acquisition of an additional 10 percent interest in APLNG from Origin Energy for approximately $1.4 billion, after customary adjustments, in an all-cash transaction resulting from the exercise of our pre-emption right. This increased our ownership in APLNG to 47.5 percent, with Origin Energy and Sinopec owning 27.5 percent and 25.0 percent, respectively. APLNG is reported as an equity investment in our Asia Pacific segment.

In March 2022, we completed the divestiture of our subsidiaries that held our Indonesia assets and operations.

In September 2022, we completed the acquisition of an additional working interest in certain Eagle Ford acreage in the Lower 48 segment for cash consideration of $236 million after customary adjustments. This agreement was accounted for as an asset acquisition, with the consideration allocated primarily to PP&E.

During 2022, we were awarded a 25 percent interest in a new joint venture (QG8) with QatarEnergy that will participate in the North Field East (NFE) LNG project. QG8 has a 12.5 percent interest in the NFE project and is reported as an equity method investment in our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment.

Change in output
Please explain
Total production of 1,738 MBOED increased 171 MBOED or 11 percent in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to:
• New wells online in the Lower 48, Alaska, Australia, China, Malaysia and Canada.
• Acquisitions including Shell Permian in the Lower 48 and additional working interest at APLNG in our Asia Pacific segment.
• Conversion of previously acquired Concho contracted volumes from a two-stream to a three-stream basis.
The increase in production during 2022 was partly offset by:
• Normal field decline.
• Divestiture of our Indonesia assets and noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment

C-OG6.13
(C-OG6.13) Report your methane emissions as percentages of natural gas and hydrocarbon production or throughput.
Oil and gas business division
Upstream
Estimated total methane emitted expressed as % of natural gas production or throughput at given division
0.29
Estimated total methane emitted expressed as % of total hydrocarbon production or throughput at given division
0.07
Details of methodology
For the first answer we divide tonnes of methane emitted by tonnes of natural gas production. For the second answer we divide tonnes of methane emitted divided by
tonnes of hydrocarbon product. Because we are calculating emissions on a gross operated basis, we assume the breakdown of 688 MMBOE gross operated production
has the same percentage split as our net production, sourced from our Annual Report. Factors used: 0.1364 tonnes/bbl crude oil and bitumen, 0.0867 tonnes/bbl NGL, 25
toe/mmscf natural gas - yielding a methane intensity of 0.29% and 0.07% for natural gas and hydrocarbon throughput, respectively.

Technology will play a major role in addressing GHG emissions, whether through reducing emissions or lowering the energy intensity of our operations or value chain. As discussed in our External Collaboration and Engagement and Public Policy sections, we participate in a number of research and industry initiatives, two of which are the Natural Gas Initiative and Oil Sands Pathways to Net-Zero Alliance. The Natural Gas Initiative is a program led by Stanford University researchers with participation from industry, government, inter-governmental organizations and foundations. The initiative aims to increase public access to information about the accuracy of methane detection and quantification technologies.

In 2022, ConocoPhillips joined the Oil Sands Pathways to Net-Zero Alliance, which includes Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy. Together this group represents the companies operating approximately 95% of Canada’s oil sands production. The goal of the alliance is to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from oil sands operations by 2050 to help Canada meet its climate goals, including the country’s Paris Agreement commitments and 2050 net-zero aspirations, with the help of CCS. ConocoPhillips is partnering with governments and the founding members of the Alliance to accelerate emissions reduction efforts.

Another way we support technology development is through our annual marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) process. The MACC process identifies and prioritizes our emissions reduction opportunities from operations based on the project’s breakeven cost. This data helps identify projects that might become viable in the future through further research, development and deployment. As a result of this work, we have focused our near-term technology investments on reducing both costs and emissions where feasible, such as improving the steam-to-oil ratio in the oil sands. Part of a new research and development effort is a multilateral well technology pilot, which enables the drilling of multiple lateral sections without the need for additional aboveground capital or additional steam injection, thereby reducing emissions intensity and operating costs.

Over the past five years we have spent more than $550 million on research and development, equipment, products and services which have reduced our GHG emissions.

An essential element of our Net-Zero Roadmap is the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC), a process to prioritize the most impactful emissions reduction projects. To drive accountability for the emissions that are within our control, the MACC provides a continuous pipeline of projects with short-, medium-, and long-term emissions reduction targets.

During our annual budget planning process, potential GHG emissions reductions projects are reviewed and ranked. The MACC plots the breakeven cost of CO2e reduction considering capital cost, operating costs and the potential increased revenue for each project against the cumulative GHG emissions that can be reduced. Project funding is based on a number of criteria including:

Cost: Cost per metric ton of CO2e abated (i.e. the lowest $/metric tons of CO₂ equivalent),
Sustainable Reduction: Reduces emissions permanently.
Scalability: Can be scaled-up to provide additional emissions reductions.
Technology Readiness: Systems and processes proven to reduce emissions by the forecasted amount.
Repeatability: Can be replicated in other business units.

We fund projects that have a break-even cost of up to $60/ metric tons of CO₂e, as well as projects that anticipate forthcoming regulatory changes.

C11.1d
(C11.1d) What is your strategy for complying with the systems you are regulated by or anticipate being regulated by?
For the facilities we operate, our strategy is to invest in on-site energy efficiency projects to directly reduce GHG emissions, thereby reducing our long-term compliance costs (either by generating emission performance credits or simply a reduction in our direct obligation). We meet any remaining liability through the most efficient means available under the local Emissions Trading Scheme, whether this be through freely issued allowances, the purchase or origination of domestic or international project-based offsets or locally issued government credits.

Explain how this internal carbon price has contributed to the implementation of your organization’s climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
We use assumptions of GHG pricing to navigate GHG regulations, drive culture shift, encourage energy efficiency and low-carbon investment, and stress test investments. In 2022, the company used a range of estimated future costs of GHG emissions for internal planning purposes, including an estimate of $60 per tonne CO2e as a sensitivity to evaluate certain future projects and opportunities. We have further developed the methodology by which qualifying projects will include assumed or actual GHG pricing in their project approval economics and long-term planning. The base case for project approval economics and planning will now include either the forecast of existing GHG pricing regulations or our current probability-weighted energy transition scenario for that jurisdiction, depending on which is higher. Where there is no GHG price regulation, we use the current transition scenario for that jurisdiction. We also run two sensitivities:

With only existing carbon pricing regulations, to reflect near-term cash more accurately.
With a sensitivity of $60 per tonne CO2e to act as a stress test to reduce the risk of stranded assets should climate regulation accelerate.

This ensures that both existing and emerging regulatory requirements are considered in our planning and decision making.

In addition to the use of carbon pricing in planning and project economics, we use it in impairment testing, cost of supply calculations, and reserve calculations.

• Impairment testing: BU Long-Range Plan submissions are the basis for the assumptions used in our impairment testing model for both operated and non-operated assets aligned with the higher of existing regulations or the carbon pricing assumptions used in the current energy scenario.

• Cost of supply: On appraised resource volumes in our cost of supply model and Long-Range Plan, we assume the higher of the carbon prices from existing regulations or those implied by the current scenario where applicable. • Reserve calculations: In accordance with SEC guidelines, the company does not use an estimated market cost of GHG emissions when assessing reserves in jurisdictions without existing GHG regulations. In jurisdictions where GHG regulations exist we base carbon prices on market actuals. In cases where existing carbon prices are not based on the market but are pre-set by a regulatory body, we use the pre-published prices (e.g. Alberta).

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
We engaged our critical suppliers as they represented a significant portion of spend and environmental footprint.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
An important element of our ongoing engagement with key suppliers is our annual Supplier Sustainability Forum. In 2022, we hosted a hybrid virtual and in-person forum to accommodate a diverse cross section of our key suppliers. With over 150 participants, including suppliers from more than 40 companies and ConocoPhillips representatives from across the globe, the agenda was designed to communicate our strategic sustainability objectives and collaborate with suppliers to manage and mitigate the environmental and social impacts from activities and operations throughout the supply chain. Through this forum, along with ongoing engagement, we are seeking to discuss how our suppliers can help us reduce our emissions while working to understand the approach they are taking to address their own emissions. Topics discussed included our:

Net-zero operational GHG emissions ambition and our Triple Mandate.
Climate risk strategy and targets.
Low Carbon Technologies focus.
Scope 3 Supplier Emissions Strategy.

The forum also included a panel discussion with ConocoPhillips leaders and industry association representatives from the National Association of Manufacturers and the Energy Workforce & Technology Council. Participants examined meaningful measures to show alignment in a world aiming for net-zero, opportunities and challenges on the road to net-zero, and opportunities for collaboration to benefit nature and communities.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
The OGMP 2.0 Initiative is a voluntary, public-private partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme, the European Commission, the Environmental Defense Fund and over 80 oil and gas companies aimed at minimizing methane emissions from global oil and gas operations. Its work has helped to raise awareness of methane emissions and contributed to the growing priority of mitigation activities.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
OGMP 2.0 has emerged as a global gold standard for methane emissions measurement and reporting. The initiative’s reporting framework will provide stakeholders with the assurance that this important greenhouse gas is being managed responsibly. In turn, participating companies will be provided with the means to credibly demonstrate that they are contributing to climate mitigation and delivering against their methane improvement objectives and targets. Joining the partnership also represents a commitment on the part of member companies to encourage improved methane reduction performance in reporting and methane emission reduction through transparency, flexibility and best practice sharing.

We prioritize and track progress through the Stakeholder Engagement Action Plan. We also engage externally through sponsorship of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change; constructively engaging in the development of climate change legislation and regulation. This relates to our value chain in everything from drilling to production to sales.

Describe the process(es) your organization has in place to ensure that your external engagement activities are consistent with your climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
Our advocacy and lobbying are aligned with our focus on reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and supporting sensible policies that reduce Scope 3 emissions. ConocoPhillips believes a well-designed pricing regime on carbon emissions is the most effective tool to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the global economy, and we continue to advocate for policies aligned with our carbon pricing principles as well as effective and efficient regulatory actions. We support the aims of the Paris Agreement, which include limiting the rise of global average temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius, as reflected in our Paris-aligned ambition to be a net-zero operational emissions company by 2050.

Climate-related policy action can support an orderly transition to a low-carbon economy, facilitate the development of innovative technology and reduce the overall risks associated with climate. Since we published our first global climate change position in 2003, we have remained consistent in our view that market-based solutions at national and global levels, rather than a patchwork of less efficient regulatory approaches, will be most effective in reducing GHG emissions.

Among our efforts, ConocoPhillips is a founding member of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interests to promote a carbon dividends framework in the U.S. as the most cost-effective, equitable and politically viable climate solution. Participation in the CLC provides an opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issues in alignment with our principles. We are also a member of Americans for Carbon Dividends (AFCD), the education and advocacy branch of the CLC, which focuses on progressing the bipartisan Baker-Shultz Carbon Dividends Plan. Our company leadership consistently engages with members of Congress and the Administration to express support for that plan. In 2021, ConocoPhillips was accepted as a Private Sector Partner within the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC), a global voluntary partnership run by the World Bank to share and expand the evidence base for effective carbon pricing policies. Participation in the CPLC further demonstrates our commitment to carbon pricing and is complementary to our engagement with the CLC.

API's Climate Framework: We share with global leaders the goal of reduced emissions across the broader economy and, specifically, those from energy production, transportation and use by society. To achieve meaningful emissions reductions that meet the climate challenge, it will take a combination of policies, innovation, industry initiatives and a partnership of government and economic sectors. The objective is large enough that no single approach can achieve it.
Industry Action Plan:
1. Accelerate Technology and Innovation to reduce emissions while meeting growing energy needs
Fast-track the Commercial Deployment of Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)
Advance Hydrogen Technology, Innovation, and Infrastructure
2. Further Mitigate Emissions from Operations to advance additional environmental progress
Advance Direct Regulation of Methane from New and Existing Sources
Develop Methane Detection Technologies
Promote Reductions in Refinery GHG Emissions and Mitigate Upstream Flaring Emissions
3. Endorse a Carbon Price Policy by government to drive economywide, market-based solutions
Potential Approach Would Price Carbon Dioxide Emissions Across the Economy
Support Policies that Provide Transparency for Consumers
Minimize Duplicative Regulations and Help Maintain U.S. Competitiveness
Avoid Carbon Leakage and Integrate with Global Carbon Markets, while Focusing on Net Emissions
4. Advance Cleaner Fuels to provide lower-carbon choices for consumers
Develop Markets for Differentiated U.S. Natural Gas
Support Policies to Advance Lower-Carbon Electricity
Reduce Lifecycle Emissions in the Transportation Sector
5. Drive Climate Reporting to provide consistency and transparency
Expand Use of ESG Reporting Guidance for the Natural Gas & Oil Industry
Report Comparable Climate-Related Indicators in New Template

The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) welcomes the Paris Agreement and supports the international community’s commitment to address the global
challenge of climate change.
We believe that the oil & gas industry is part of the solution to this challenge, which should be addressed while meeting society’s future energy needs. The long-term
objective of any climate change policy should be to reduce the risk of serious impacts on society and ecosystems, while recognizing the importance of availability, reliability
and affordability of energy to society, which is essential to human prosperity and well-being.

NGSA recognizes that the burning of fossil fuels leads to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which contribute to climate change.
NGSA supports the ambition of achieving economy-wide net zero GHG emissions by 2050, consistent with our support for the goals of the Paris Agreement.
NGSA advocates for rules and policies that protect the environment while allowing our members to continue to supply electric utilities, manufacturers, businesses and
households with affordable and reliable natural gas.
Energy policies must allow consumers to reap the benefits of our natural gas resources, ensuring that no consumers are left behind as we transition to a clean and
affordable energy future.
Natural gas has played a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions from the U.S. power sector to 25-year lows because of its relatively low carbon content and because of
its role as an integral partner to renewables. NGSA members believe that adopting a price on carbon can further drive down carbon emissions, while protecting consumers
and maintaining competition and innovation in power markets.

NAM recognizes that Climate change is happening. Human activities are contributing. The NAM supports the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement to significantly reduce the risks and impacts of global climate change. Manufacturers are committed to helping address climate change while increasing the global competitiveness of U.S. industries. U.S.
manufacturers are leading and the results have been unprecedented: we are significantly more carbon efficient than most of our global competitors, and the U.S. has reduced its total GHG emissions more than any other nation. We are committed to being part of the solution and encourage all other sectors of the American economy to
join us. Manufacturers are advocating for policies that encourage domestic emissions reductions so that the U.S. continues to lead on the global stage, driving our international counterparts to do the same. All sectors of the global economy will have to do their part to limit global GHG emissions. U.S. manufacturers are both creators and users of the technologies that will be vital to reducing global emissions. Accordingly, sound policy for U.S. manufacturers is one that reduces emissions while maintaining their global competitiveness.
Policymakers should pursue policies that achieve meaningful, cost-effective GHG reductions while empowering U.S. manufacturers to thrive in the global marketplace and
ensuring the affordable, reliable energy supplies needed to keep our economy strong. https://www.nam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Energy-and-Environment-

For more than a decade, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has asserted that the climate is changing, humans are contributing to these changes, and inaction is not an
option.
The Chamber’s members are already developing, financing, building, and operating the innovative solutions needed to effectively reduce emissions, combat climate change, and meet rising energy demands. We support market-based solutions to reduce emissions and support U.S. competitiveness, national security, and American workers.
Mobilized business community support for the 2020 passage of the Energy Act, ensuring it contained innovation-focused measures that addressed climate change,
promoted American technological leadership,and fostered continued economic growth.
Played a leading role in the passing of bipartisan legislation to implement a phase down of hydrofluorocarbons, which will have a major direct impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Called for direct regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas operations, worked with Congress to help improve pre-disaster mitigation and resilience policies, and
supported legislation that would mobilize private capital to promote carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration technologies.
Supports bipartisan infrastructure legislation that would provide $100 billion to advance efforts to decarbonize the economy, leading a coalition of more than 300 business,
environmental, and labor organizations in support of the bill.

American oil and gas producers have an irreplaceable role in meeting the challenge of global climate change. AXPC, representing large independent American oil and gas producers, supports innovative, collaborative solutions that lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while meeting the world’s growing need for abundant, low cost, reliable energy. Successful public policy must recognize that oil and gas underpins our standard of living and American oil and gas is critical to our national security and economic prosperity.
The following principles will guide AXPC’s climate advocacy efforts, including policy that:
Facilitates meaningful GHG emissions reductions
Requires proportional participation from all sectors of the economy
Utilizes fair, consistent and transparent measurement methodologies across industries
Encourages and appropriately accounts for early and/or voluntary actions
Minimizes inconsistent, redundant and/or contradictory regulations and policies
Attributes to energy producers only emissions arising during production operations
Balances economic, environmental and energy security needs
Ensures the development of critical energy infrastructure
Makes the costs and associated climate benefits of any policy fully transparent to the American public
Ensures that the United States shoulders an equitable burden under international agreements
Does not disadvantage American oil and gas producers and workers against foreign competitors
Promotes innovation
Champions economy-wide public and private investment to develop cost-effective technologies that will materially reduce GHG emissions
Relies upon predictable and economically efficient policy frameworks, such as the use of market-based policies and/or offsets, to deliver outcomes at the lowest cost to
society
Allows all energy sources to compete for innovation funding
