C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Sustainability is an inspiration for growth – a foundation to fulfill our mission and deepen our societal impact by improving the health and well-being of the people we serve. 



At UnitedHealth Group, sustainability is our ambition for strategic, long-term growth, embedded in our businesses and intrinsically linked by a common mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. 



Our four sustainability priorities – 1) helping to build a modern, high-performing health system; 2) healthy environment; 3) our people and culture; and 4) responsible business practices – are informed by our stakeholders and reflect contemporary challenges, including social inequities, climate change and access to affordable, high-quality medical care. These priorities align with our five growth pillars – value-based care; health benefits; health technology; health financial services; and pharmacy services – representing the ways we can seek to help every person who interacts with the health care system every day. 



The ultimate success of our company is the creation of enduring, long-term value for both our shareholders and society at large. It’s an ambition influenced by the more than 400,000 people who work across Optum and UnitedHealthcare, the workplace culture we build, our impact on the planet, strong corporate governance and our ability to help build a health system capable of responding to the needs of the people it serves.

Description of process
UnitedHealth Group actively monitors climate change-related risks and opportunities as well as all other important organization risks for potential material impacts, specifically pertaining to our global operations and the health care services marketplace as a part of our mature Enterprise Risk Management program.

UHG levers its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team to identify and affirm mitigation strategies for climate-related risks at the enterprise level. Many teams are accountable to bring any such risks to the attention of ERM team including the Office of Sustainability, Real Estate Services, Enterprise Sourcing and Procurement, Environmental Health and Safety, Enterprise Resilience and others.

To manage these types of natural risks, our Enterprise Resilience team monitors, prepares, and responds to weather crises. This includes risk-based crisis management and business continuity planning process, disaster preparedness awareness, scenario-based exercises, 24x7 incident response center, and emergency communications.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
As a global Fortune 5 company, one example of risks monitored for current regulations include European Union and United Kingdom regulations on carbon disclosures and energy assessments. The UnitedHealth Group business operations in these areas are subject to regulations on carbon disclosures and energy assessments that include the risk of financial penalties impacting UnitedHealth Group’s financial performance. To manage this risk, UnitedHealth Group’s Environmental Management Team (EMT) coordinates with UnitedHealth Group’s UK business units to confirm which registered businesses meet the criteria for each scheme. After the site lists are established, the EMT supports the carbon footprint disclosure and energy assessments.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
As a publicly traded company, UnitedHealth Group is monitoring potential action and future disclosure required to comply with the SEC's proposed climate disclosure ruling.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
UnitedHealth Group is developing and advancing technology to help connect people to care where and when they need it. Our integration of virtual and in-person services provides a more accessible, personalized and seamless care experience. Our Optum virtual care platform enables patients to connect with their own care provider from anywhere. It facilitates telehealth capabilities and broad access to Optum’s physicians, community-based clinics, pharmacies and home health services in all 50 states. UnitedHealthcare’s virtual-first health plan empowers members to connect with Optum’s virtual-based care team for help with everything from urgent care to primary and behavioral health care services. We support individuals with structured, measurement-based mental health care through a suite of virtual solutions supported by licensed clinical social workers and coaches to help members with mild to complex behavioral health needs. Similarly, our self-guided app offers on-demand digital treatment support for stress, anxiety and depression, providing clinically validated techniques and tools.
Legal	
Relevant, always included
One example of this risk type is the OptumRx pharmaceutical benefit management line of business. Concentrated in three national distribution centers and five regional locations, strength of management processes and procedures are of paramount importance to UnitedHealth Group and are intended to manage regulatory and environmental compliance as well as member and employee safety. An additional example of this risk is associated management of medical waste in the Optum Care clinical operations and at OptumRx infusion centers. Practitioners are treating patients in person at these locations. UnitedHealth Group manages regulatory and environmental compliance as well as member and employee safety. Legal risk comes in the form of compliance, regulatory and reputational risk.
Market	
Relevant, always included
As the U.S. electricity supply continues to add new sources of renewable energy, alternative energy and energy storage to the grid, further deregulation of electricity markets will allow customers to access the resources and could drive down energy costs. UnitedHealth Group’s Environmental Management Team (EMT) monitors and leverages deregulated energy market opportunities through energy supply contracts.
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
At UnitedHealth Group, we understand the important role the environment plays in the health of every community. We believe the environment is a key part of what makes the communities in which we live and work sustainable, viable and healthy. Our Environmental Management Team has established a comprehensive Environmental Management System (EMS) to mitigate reputation risks by decreasing the environmental impact of operations through Corporate Environmental Policy Objectives and Environmental Focus Areas.
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included
As a global company, we have operations in regions vulnerable to extreme weather and changing precipitation patterns, which have the potential to impact our operations. Over the past few years, both the frequency and severity of these types of weather events have increased. Most recently, in 2021, we experienced events that impacted our operations. One example was the February 13–17, 2021, North American winter storm, unofficially referred to as Winter Storm Uri, which caused a widespread major power crisis in Texas. To manage this risk, we incorporate environmental management into our Real Estate Services (RES) platform and collaborate with Enterprise Resilience (ER) to monitor weather-related risks. Our enterprise utilizes a risk-based business continuity planning process that includes risk scenario-based exercises, written contingency plans and a 24x7 incident response center.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, always included
Air pollution increases the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer. Extreme heat is linked to increased hospital admissions for cardiovascular, kidney and respiratory disorders. Intensifying wildfires can lead to an increase in emergency department visits for respiratory conditions like asthma or bronchitis. While every person is impacted by the health of our environment, the impacts of climate change are distributed unequally among disadvantaged populations in the U.S. and around the globe. Communities of color, low-income populations and older adults are among those most likely to feel the impact of climate change, further exacerbating existing health inequities.

Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
To manage this risk, we incorporate environmental management into our Enterprise Real Estate Services (RES) platform and collaborate with Enterprise Resilience (ER) to monitor weather-related risks. Our Enterprise utilizes a risk-based business continuity planning process that includes risk scenario-based exercises, written contingency plans and a 24x7 incident response center. These plans apply across our global lines of businesses and create operational redundancies to address the majority of this risk. More specifically, where we have identified critical sites with the highest risk of impact we have backup emergency systems. We developed a multi-dimensional risk-based investment strategy to deploy backup emergency power systems at these critical sites to mitigate the potential effects of extended power outages. These risk areas included compliance, financial, business continuity and utility risk model inputs. Sites exemplifying these risks include our core U.S. pharmaceutical portfolio. No such costs were significant to UHG.

We are committed to addressing the impact the environment has on human health, including in the supply chain. For that reason, we have made climate risk a key component of our ongoing sustainable procurement activities. We collaborate with the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) to retrieve qualitative and GHG emissions data from targeted suppliers to establish a baseline from which future reduction goals will be developed. The targeted suppliers represented roughly 45% of our centrally managed procurement spend in 2022 and account for a material basis of GHG emissions across our spend categories. We will continue to use this data to inform our GHG scope 3 inventory and engage our suppliers on climate risks and opportunities going forward.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Plan for achieving the target: Our strategy relies on direct mitigation of global emissions. This approach prioritizes reducing energy consumption within our operations while improving energy efficiency and transitioning to renewable energy sources. As part of our net-zero commitment, we intend to support the development of additional renewable energy sources, as well as directly generate renewable energy to power our operations, when possible. Simultaneously, we are initiating energy efficiency improvements at key sites within our footprint. We expect gradual reductions in total emissions while these actions are being implemented. In line with our plan to achieve this target, in 2022, we initiated a Building Management System (BMS) pilot to support the diverse and extensive network of properties in our portfolio; continued to invest in energy efficiency projects, including LED fixture upgrades and HVAC system replacements; continued working to establish global sustainability standards, which can be used to guide leasing, renovation and new builds; began the process of installing on-site solar panels at our Optum headquarters in Minnesota; continued exploring virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), which would allow us to apply renewable energy credits across our portfolio while also supporting the generation of new sources of renewable energy; and initiated a pilot study to test the feasibility of issuing electric vehicles to clinicians who travel to patient homes as part of their work.

Progress made to the end of the reporting year: We have seen a 4.7% increase in emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) in 2022 due to growth, largely through mergers and acquisitions, and increased site occupancy post-pandemic. We have focused on building a roadmap to increase energy efficiency and pursue generation of new renewable energy. While we expect to see increases across many of our environmental metrics over the short term as our company grows, the approaches we are formulating today are being designed to dramatically reduce our environmental footprint over the next seven to 20 years.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Plan for achieving the target: As part of our net-zero commitment, we intend to support the development of additional renewable energy sources, as well as directly generate renewable energy to power our operations, when possible. In line with our plan to achieve this target, in 2022, we began the process of installing on-site solar panels at our Optum headquarters in Minnesota (project completion expected in summer 2024) and continued exploring virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), which would allow us to apply renewable energy credits across our portfolio while also supporting the generation of new sources of renewable energy. After our initial work to generate renewable power on-site and execute our first VPPAs in the U.S., we plan to continue exploring other renewable energy procurement options globally.

Progress made to the end of the reporting year: In 2022, we honed our roadmap for identifying and scaling our transition to renewable energy sources so we could most effectively decrease our GHG emissions and help improve the health of the communities where we operate. Starting in 2022, as we transition to higher quality emissions reductions solutions, such as a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) and direct investment in renewable energy, we plan to rely less on some carbon reduction levers, including unbundled RECs. This is why the reported value for renewable energy use in 2022 is 0 MWh.

In 2023, UnitedHealth Group plans to create a holistic approach to water conservation across its enterprise, including creating design guidelines for water efficiency and water quality.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
We are working to reduce excess water consumption – a critical and increasingly worrisome global health issue – by taking steps to help ensure our facilities use water as efficiently as possible, which is particularly important for water-stressed and water-sensitive locations across the globe. We continue to advance plumbing and irrigation projects and sustainable landscape projects aimed at reducing our water usage. After implementing a holistic water-tracking program for our India real estate portfolio in 2021 to remotely measure, monitor and influence water usage, we found about 47% of total water usage is currently treated/recycled water instead of fresh water. In 2022, we expanded this effort to add water meters in our five sites in the Philippines.

UnitedHealth Group’s holistic approach to water conservation across its enterprise, including the creation of design guidelines for water efficiency and water quality, will be developed by its subject matter expert and partner teams.

In 2023, UnitedHealth Group plans to implement new solutions to improve efficiency and reduce waste, including reducing single-use plastic, exploring opportunities to expand composting and recycling services, evaluating design and construction processes, and continuing to improve waste data collection.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
We are dedicated to managing and preventing waste by piloting new, innovative solutions designed for long-term waste reduction. We take a multidimensional approach to minimizing our environmental impact through ongoing management of our various waste streams, including municipal, construction, electronic, hazardous and regulated medical and pharmaceutical waste. Our 2022 scope 3 assessment included an enterprise-wide, waste-associated inventory, which will help inform our waste management and reduction strategy in 2023 and beyond.

In 2022, we implemented several new pilots to reduce waste and improve patient care: we converted prescriptions to larger pack sizes, which reduced our plastic bottle usage by approximately 546,000 bottles in 2022; we used insulated mailers to ship medications requiring refrigeration, which in turn reduced our gel pack usage by eliminating 489,000 unnecessary coolers; eight sites in India established on-site composting of organic material, which has diverted 129,254 pounds of waste so far; and we established a zero-landfill project in two 150-bed hospitals in Brazil.

In 2023, collaborating with a diverse set of stakeholders including employers, consumers, providers, health equity advocates and other players in the health care industry, UnitedHealth Group plans to continue building on and progressing its goal of reducing paper usage across the health system. UnitedHealth Group is keenly focused on addressing regulatory requirements, which currently account for roughly 40% of its paper use.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
As we continue to modernize our processes and technologies to create simple, seamless consumer experiences, we have made significant progress toward our goal of reducing paper usage across the health system.

In 2022, our efforts resulted in 1 billion pieces of paper saved, 24 million envelopes saved, and a 24% reduction in inbound paper volume.

We started by identifying simple changes with an immediate impact, such as shifting provider groups to digital rather than paper-based communications for activities like prior authorizations and claims decisions, as well as eliminating unnecessary print marketing materials. As one example, we have typically included an envelope with every pharmacy order we send out. A newly developed system automatically identifies and includes an envelope only on orders where there is an invoice with a balance due. The result: more than a 90% reduction in the volume of envelopes used, which is estimated to save more than 35 million envelopes in 2023.

Beyond the environmental impact, reducing paper usage has also improved the speed and simplicity of our communications with consumers and providers by replacing paper-based communications with digital tools. In 2022, 91 types of member and provider transactions were digitized or enhanced, leading to faster turnaround times and reductions in wait times for some claims reimbursements from 10 days to 24 hours. In addition, provider digital document delivery was up 200% over 2021, with over 1.6 million providers enrolled in e-delivery. About 98% of total claims on our core platforms were submitted digitally.

We are working toward providing even more (and better) paperless experiences for consumers and providers – a dual-purpose goal designed to minimize use of energy, water and raw materials while creating a better consumer experience.

Planned milestones and/or near-term investments for neutralization at target year
UnitedHealth Group recognizes that achieving net-zero involves reducing emissions to as close to zero as possible, with minimal use of offsets. In line with requirements from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), UHG plans to neutralize no more than 5% of its baseline year Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions with high quality carbon removals in the target year.

Method	Comment
Dedicated budget for energy efficiency
UnitedHealth Group maintains a dedicated budget for energy efficiency projects and programs. Using this budget, UHG is scaling solutions that reduce energy consumption in its entire real estate footprint – ranging from data centers and pharmaceutical distribution centers to clinical care facilities. This approach includes new construction projects, renovations, collaboration with landlords, and employee behavior programs. In 2022, UHG initiated a Building Management System (BMS) pilot that has the potential to reduce energy consumption by up to 20% over previous systems in the facilities where implemented, decreased internal nighttime lighting in its Ireland office (expected to save 5,000 kWh per year), and continued to invest in other energy efficiency projects such as LED lighting fixture upgrades and HVAC system replacements. UHG is also working to establish global sustainability standards, which can be used to guide leasing, renovation, and new builds.
Dedicated budget for other emissions reduction activities
UnitedHealth Group maintains a dedicated budget for other emissions reduction activities as well – projects and programs beyond just energy efficiency. Using this budget, UHG is honing its roadmap for identifying and scaling its transition to renewable energy sources so it can most effectively decrease its GHG emissions and help improve the health of the communities where it operates. UHG is installing on-site solar panels at its Optum headquarters in Minnesota (completion expected summer 2024). Once operational, this project is expected to meet approximately 50% of the site’s energy needs. UHG is also exploring virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), which would allow it to apply renewable energy credits across its portfolio while also supporting the generation of new sources of renewable energy. After its initial work to optimize energy efficiency, generate renewable power on-site, and execute its first VPPAs in the U.S., UHG plans to continue exploring other renewable energy procurement options globally. The dedicated budget for other emissions reduction activities has also yielded a pilot study to test the feasibility of issuing electric vehicles to clinicians who travel to patient homes as part of their work and several waste reduction pilot programs.

In 2021, we reported for the first time all energy and all associated scope 1 and 2 emissions within our operational control. The reporting methodology was updated in 2021 to shift assets previously reported under scope 3, category 8 – upstream leased assets to scope 1 and scope 2. All greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in accordance with the guidance set out by The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). In 2022, we have aligned to the “fixed base year” and “all-year” approach for recalculating historical emissions, which includes acquisitions and divestitures. 2021 base year energy and associated scope 1 and 2 emissions have been updated to reflect these changes. Prior years not updated.

UnitedHealth Group has a specific policy in place outlining and governing the prerequisites and procedures for the recalculation of base year emissions. This policy states that updates to/recalculation of base year emissions should occur annually as UnitedHealth Group will update/recalculate its base year emissions reporting every year in which inorganic growth or reduction occurs. Inorganic growth or reduction is defined as mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, outsourcing/insourcing of emitting activities, changes to emissions calculation methodology, or the discovery of significant errors that could alter base year emissions. The presence of inorganic growth or reduction each year (mainly via mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestitures) is likely. UHG’s recalculation policy lays out clear steps for how to handle past and present emissions data associated with acquisitions and divestitures.

Changes due to organic growth or contraction, such as the opening or closing of offices, do not trigger an update/recalculation of base year emissions.

Starting in 2022, as we transition to higher quality emissions reductions solutions, such as a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) and direct investment in renewable energy, we plan to rely less on some carbon reduction levers, including unbundled RECs. In 2022, no unbundled RECs were purchased; therefore, market-based and location-based scope 2 emissions are the same.

In 2022, we completed our first-ever scope 3 assessment, which identified the most significant categories of emissions from both upstream sources — such as purchased goods and services, waste generated in operations and employee commuting — and downstream sources, such as investments. Our assessment showed two areas of emissions account for the vast majority of our GHG footprint: Purchased goods and services & Investments. Our deeper assessment in 2021 indicated emissions from this category (Fuel-and-energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2)) may be present in our business model, yet less significant than other reported categories. We plan to evaluate whether this category remains applicable for our business model to make meaningful GHG reductions in the years to come.

The 2022 dataset represents employee commuting for integrated U.S. based employees. In 2022, we updated our reporting methodology/assumptions which resulted in increased emissions year-over-year. GHG emissions are calculated using the GHG inventory “Average-data method”, which involves estimating emissions from employee commuting based on average (e.g., national) data on commuting patterns. The assumptions made in 2022 include:

Employees were in office either 0, 1, 3, or 5 days per week based on their designation (Work From Home, No Assignment, Hybrid, or Core-Onsite respectively)

Commutes within the same zip code were 4 miles total round trip

All commutes are round trip

These values represent:

1) the Scope 1 (natural gas, propane, and fuel oil usage) and Scope 2 (grid purchased electricity) emissions that can be definitively associated with UnitedHealth Group corporate facilities in the United States and around the world.

2) the Scope 1 (natural gas, propane, and fuel oil usage) and Scope 2 (grid purchased electricity) emissions associated with facilities in the United States that are not currently allocated to Optum, UnitedHealthcare, or UnitedHealth Group corporate (all international facilities are allocated to either Optum, UnitedHealthcare, or UnitedHealth Group corporate).

3) the Scope 1 emissions from corporate aircraft, refrigerant use, medical gas use, fleet vehicle use, and stationary diesel consumption that are currently aggregated on the UnitedHealth Group level. This explains why the UnitedHealth Group Scope 1 emissions appear so high.

Our gross Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions increased by 4.7% from 2021 to 2022. This increase was reduced by our execution of HVAC and lighting replacement/upgrade (energy efficiency and emissions reduction) projects in the reporting year. Our total Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions in the previous reporting year was 483,610 mtCO2e; therefore, we arrived at a 0.03% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions attributable to other emissions reduction activities through (-158.06/483,610)*100 = -0.03% (i.e.., a 0.03% decrease in emissions).

An increase of 22,800.06 mtCO2e from 2021 to 2022 is from unidentified sources, although we believe increases in energy and carbon emissions metrics are primarily due to company growth, largely through mergers and acquisitions of more energy intensive spaces (e.g., care delivery) that haven’t been touched by our energy efficiency programs/initiatives yet, and increases in building occupancy due to employees returning to offices. Our total Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions in the previous reporting year was 483,610 mtCO2e; therefore, we arrived at a 4.71% increase in Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions attributable to unidentified sources through (22,800.06/483,610)*100 = 4.71% (i.e.., a 4.71% increase in emissions).

Additional details about ACR approaches to address reversal risk: “For projects with a risk of reversal of GHG emission reductions/removals, Project Proponents must assess risk using an ACR-approved risk assessment tool and enter into a legally binding Reversal Risk Mitigation Agreement with ACR. Project Proponents must then mitigate reversal risk by contributing offsets to the ACR Buffer Pool (either from the project itself, or ERTs of any other type and vintage); by providing evidence of sufficient insurance coverage with an ACR-approved insurance product to recover any future reversal; or by using another ACR-approved risk management mechanism.”

As stated in The American Carbon Registry Standard v7.0 (pages 49-51): “ACR requires that projects adhere to environmental and community safeguards best practices to: ensure that projects “do no harm” by maintaining compliance with local, national, and international laws and regulations; identify environmental and community risks and impacts and contributions to sustainable development; detail how negative environmental and community impacts will be avoided, reduced, mitigated, or compensated, and how mechanisms will be monitored, managed, and enforced; ensure that the rights of affected communities and other stakeholders are recognized, and that they have been fully and effectively engaged and consulted; and ensure that ongoing communications and grievance redress mechanisms are in place, and that affected communities will share in the project benefits. ACR requires all projects to prepare and disclose an environmental and community impact assessment.”

Additional details about CAR methods to assess additionality for this project: From the CAR’s Forest Project Protocol v3.1 (the Protocol used for this project) (pages 6-8): “Forest Projects must satisfy the following tests to be considered additional: Legal requirements test; and Performance test (Forest Projects must achieve GHG reductions or removals above and beyond any GHG reductions or removals that would result from engaging in Business As Usual activities, as defined by the requirements described below). An Avoided Conversion project satisfies the performance test if the Forest Owner provides a real estate appraisal for the Project Area (as defined in Section 4) indicating the following: the project area is suitable for conversion; and the alternative land use for the Project Area has a higher market value than forestland.”

Additional details about CAR approaches to address reversal risk: From the CAR’s Forest Project Protocol v3.1 (pages 56-59): “The Reserve ensures the permanence of GHG reductions and removals through three mechanisms: 1) The requirement for all Forest Owners to monitor onsite carbon stocks, submit annual monitoring reports, and submit to annual third-party verification of those reports along with periodic verifier site visits (as detailed in Sections 8 through 10 of this protocol) for the duration of the Project Life. 2) The requirement for all Forest Owners to sign a Project Implementation Agreement with the Reserve, as described in Section 3.5, which obligates Forest Owners to retire CRTs to compensate for reversals of GHG reductions and removals. 3) The maintenance of a Buffer Pool to provide insurance against reversals of GHG reductions and removals due to unavoidable causes (including natural disturbances such a fires, pest infestations, or disease outbreaks).”

From the CAR’s Forest Project Protocol v3.1 (page 11): “Forest Projects can create long-term climate benefits as well as provide other environmental benefits, including the sustaining of natural ecosystem processes. This protocol requires eligible projects to employ both sustainable harvesting practices and natural forest management practices.” For example, “Forest Owner must be certified under the Forest Stewardship Council, Sustainable Forestry Initiative, or Tree Farm System certification programs” and “All Forest Projects are required to establish and/or maintain forest types that are native to the Project Area”.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Our formalized processes for supplier sustainability engagement continue to evolve as we enhance our focus in this area. It is notable that the health care industry is not generally seen as a heavy carbon user or producer. This directly impacts the number of available suppliers who have sustainable carbon management programs in place. Our current rationale for coverage includes reviewing the sustainability practices of our most critical suppliers based on a variety of criteria, including volume levels, delivery of critical components, and non-substitutable suppliers.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
UHG’s supplier sustainability screening process aims to identify supplier goals for waste and carbon reduction, recycling and any other sustainability measurements in place. In 2022, the questionnaire was administered to 498 suppliers, with 231 (46%) identifying programmatic efforts and 101 (20%) with carbon reduction goals in place. Success is measured by improvement in supplier sustainability metrics/measurements over baselines established with the survey data, in addition to an increase in the number of suppliers reporting.

The first step is to identify in scope assets within the investment portfolio. This includes listed equity, unlisted equity, corporate bonds, sovereigns, and business loans. An attribution factor is used to identify UHG’s share of the financed emissions for each company. The attribution factor is the book value of investment over the company’s EVIC or total capital. The attribution factor is multiplied by the company’s reported or estimated emissions to calculate UHG’s financed emissions for the investee company. The final portfolio emissions are the sum of each investment’s individual emissions. If no emissions data is available, a GICS subindustry average is used and adjusted for company revenue.
