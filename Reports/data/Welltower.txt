Welltower Inc. - Climate Change 2023
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Welltower is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that partners with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute care providers and health systems to provide high-quality and affordable health care for an aging population. Through Welltower’s capital investments, health care providers and operators are able to grow, innovate and ultimately improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience.  



All properties owned by Welltower throughout the entirety (or a portion) of calendar year 2022 are included in the entity's reporting boundaries and portfolio composition for this reporting year. Loans (0% ownership), properties under construction and land are excluded from the asset list and are outside of the reporting boundaries for Welltower. Welltower defines its control boundary using the financial control approach. Under this approach, medical office buildings that are directly managed by Welltower and seniors housing operating properties in Welltower’s portfolio are included within the control boundary (Scope 1 and 2), with triple-net  properties considered outside of the financial boundary and included in Scope 3. An inventory management plan (IMP) was developed and describes the data sources and methodology used to prepare Welltower’s 2022 greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. Both the IMP and an accompanying GHG inventory are created in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) guidance and best practices for calculation emissions associated with Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources and Indirect Emissions from Purchased Electricity. 



Welltower has implemented an award-winning environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) program that aims to promote sustainability and wellness for our employees, tenants and residents through a full range of initiatives. 2022 was a year of significant advances in ESG for Welltower in response to both investor expectations and employee engagement. Some of our ESG accomplishments include receiving the 2023 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award at the level of ‘Sustained Excellence’ as recognition of our ongoing efforts to promote energy efficiency across our portfolio, forming the Welltower ESG Steering Committee, setting an emissions reduction goal approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, and conducting a portfolio-wide climate change scenario analysis.

Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
Ultimate management-level responsibility for Welltower's corporate sustainability program is with the CEO of the Company, who sits on the Board of Directors. The CEO meets with other Board members frequently. The CEO is kept up to date on sustainability topics by the CFO and the AVP, Capital Markets & ESG. The strong relationship between the most senior decision makers and those with responsibility for sustainability allows action points to be implemented into company operations effectively. Recently, Welltower launched the ESG Steering Committee co-headed by the CEO and the AVP, Capital Markets & ESG, as a cross functional committee to assist the Company in setting and implementing ESG strategy, identifying risks and opportunities and making recommendations regarding these matters. The CEO supported the decision to publicly disclose our goal of a 10% reduction in energy usage, water usage and GHG emissions intensities by 2025 (against a 2018 baseline) and continues to request and monitor our progress against this goal as reported in our annual ESG Report. Additionally, our CEO supports our ESG team in its engagement with operators around reporting their sustainability data and information, as well as supports the decision to incorporate sustainability goals in determining executive compensation including increased data coverage and progress towards reduction targets.
Board-level committee
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of Welltower's Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of Welltower's sustainability program, which includes the Company's efforts to implement sustainability-related goals and targets, mitigate the impacts of climate change on the business and manage overall corporate governance and the social impacts of the Company’s operations.

Reviewing and guiding the risk management process
<Not Applicable>
The Board and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee oversee and review the management of risks including compliance, environmental sustainability and corporate governance. Management is responsible for identifying Welltower’s significant risks, developing risk management strategies and policies and integrating risk management into Welltower’s decision-making process. To that end, Welltower has implemented an enterprise risk management program (based on the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework) and created an internal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Committee charged with identifying, monitoring and mitigating risks and exposures. The ERM Committee, through regular communication with business areas throughout the year, identifies and evaluates sustainability and climate-related enterprise risks that may affect the Company’s business functions. Opportunities are channeled back to management’s strategy setting process and risks are added to the central Risk Register (Excel-based) where a qualitative description and mitigation measures for each risk are detailed. A report of the risks identified and results of mitigation efforts are reported to the Board regularly. In regards to climate-related mitigation measures, Welltower takes a multi-faceted approach including implementing water, energy and waste management programs to improve the efficiency of the portfolio and minimize GHG emissions. In addition, the implementation of disaster recovery plans and adequate insurance policies are used to mitigate risks associated with extreme weather events. In 2022, Welltower ran all of its assets through Moody's Climate on Demand platform, and the results were discussed and shared with the Board. This ERM structure enables information regarding significant risks and exposures to the Company to be monitored and communicated to Welltower leadership and the Board.

C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
Page 30 of our 2022 Form 10-K states: "Our business model and the operations of our business involve risks, including those related to losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change." Welltower further defines a substantive financial or strategic impact in relation to identifying or assessing climate-related risks according to page 31 of our 2022 Form 10-K: "The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price."



Moreover, page 39 of our 2022 Form 10-K states: "We may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change, which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, unanticipated costs associated with evacuation, a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property. We maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods, as well as the effects of climate change. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including the costs associated with evacuation. Moreover, an increase in volatility and difficulty predicting adverse weather events, such as the changes in tornado patterns in recent years, may result in additional losses. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property... Also, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue."



Specific quantifiable indicators include:



- FFO (Funds from Operations): Our 2022 normalized FFO per diluted share was $3.35. The Compensation Committee set 2022 target normalized FFO of $3.46 per diluted share to align with Welltower’s annual business plan (2023 Proxy, pg. 42). A negative impact to FFO per diluted share, of at least 1-2 cents would have a substantive financial impact as it could cause the Company to miss its publicly issued normalized FFO per diluted share guidance or board approved targets.

- Loss of capital invested in a property: Significant property damage or destruction of our properties because of climate change that result in losses of over tens of millions of dollars of capital invested in our properties

- Credit Rating: Our current credit rating is BBB+/Baa1. Any events that lead to a negative impact on our credit rating, as a result of a decrease in cash flow from climate-related events, would have a substantive financial impact.

Description of process
Welltower's Enterprise Risk Management system helps ensure structured, consistent and continuous risk management processes are in place across the entire organization, which includes all global operations. The Board and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee play an integral role in overseeing the management of Welltower’s risks and regularly reviews Welltower’s material risks and exposures, including operational, strategic, financial and compliance risks.

Management is responsible for identifying Welltower’s significant risks, developing risk management strategies and policies and integrating risk management into Welltower’s decision-making process. To that end, Welltower has implemented an enterprise risk management program (based on the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework) and created an internal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Committee charged with identifying, monitoring and mitigating risks and exposures. The ERM Committee, through regular communication with business areas throughout the year, identifies and evaluates risks that may affect the Company’s business functions. Opportunities are channelled back to management’s strategy setting process and risks are added to the central Risk Register (Excel-based) where a qualitative description and mitigation measures for each risk are detailed. A report of the risks identified and results of mitigation efforts are reported to the Board regularly. In regard to climate risk mitigation measures, Welltower takes a multi-faceted approach including implementing water, energy and waste management programs to improve the efficiency of the portfolio and minimize GHG emissions. In addition, the implementation of disaster recovery plans and adequate insurance policies are used to mitigate risks associated with extreme weather events. This ERM structure enables information regarding significant risks and exposures to the Company to be monitored and communicated to Welltower leadership and the Board.

Additionally, Welltower utilized Moody’s Risk Management Solutions Climate on Demand platform to perform a portfolio-wide climate change analysis to help identify and measure climate risk exposure. This climate change analysis enabled Welltower to group risks by timeframe and climate scenario as well as identify opportunities for risk mitigation. The outcome of the analysis was shared with the Risk Committee for incorporation into our company-wide risk register as part of our ERM system.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Welltower’s ESG team, development team and third-party consultants consistently monitor and assess current climate-related regulations applicable to our portfolio including any required building construction standards or municipal benchmarking reporting requirements for our portfolio. Non-compliance with municipal benchmarking may result in fines.

In addition, the Audit Committee oversees Welltower's compliance program with respect to legal and regulatory requirements and our ERM Committee seeks to ensure there are mitigants in place for all compliance-related risks identified in the Risk Register.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
The ESG Steering Committee, Audit Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee monitor potential emerging climate-related legislative and regulatory changes that will impact Welltower. For example, in the United States, the SEC has announced a proposal that would require public companies to report on their carbon emissions and risks. This rule change would require Welltower to publicly disclose the details of their carbon emissions and provide information about their exposure to climate-related risks.

There are also an increasing number of national, state and local policies and ordinances around energy and carbon reduction and benchmarking in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada. Legislation continues to increase and there is a potential for new legislation to require companies to meet certain energy/water performance standards or carbon reduction standards with potential fines for non-compliance.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
As technology continues to advance, outdated and inefficient systems may need to be replaced or upgraded to optimize the operational efficiency of our buildings. Risks of not keeping up with the latest technology include not realizing potential energy and water consumption savings, not meeting our public GHG, energy and water reduction goals and not keeping up with consumer and tenant preferences.

Welltower undertakes operational energy and water efficiency assessments across the portfolio and supports tenants to implement efficiency upgrades that provide improved environmental performance and could potentially lower utility consumption and costs. For example, Welltower's efforts have been recognized annually with the ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award (since 2021) and Welltower has facilitated 391 LED retrofit projects to date.
Legal	
Relevant, always included
From time to time, we are directly involved or named as a party in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses, significantly divert the attention of management and could damage our reputation and our brand. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business. We cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage.
Market	
Relevant, always included
In addition to policy and regulatory/legal risks, Welltower continuously monitors all transition risks that may have a material impact on the Company's business activities and assets through review of the regularly updated Risk Register, which is a tool that prioritizes risks as low, medium and high. Welltower consistently reviews its own ESG reporting methods, recognitions and awards and ESG strategies, as well as those of their peers, to make sure Welltower keeps up to date with market trends and meets the changing expectations of its key stakeholders. If Welltower is unable to meet future market expectations, this may be a risk to growth and future earnings.

For each identified risk in the Risk Register, the Risk Committee ranks the likelihood of the risk (possible, frequent, etc.), the potential impact of the risk (low, medium, high), controls / risk mitigants in place and whether they are effective at mitigating the risk, the residual risk and the factors impacting that risk. Material risks are those with medium or high residual risks. Depending on the severity of the risk, Welltower uses this consistent process to develop a plan to mitigate the process. Further analysis is conducted with the Risk Committee and other relevant members and follow up is continued until the risk is lowered.
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
Increasingly, tenants and investors are looking to work with environmentally responsible companies. Negative perceptions of Welltower relative to the Company’s response to environmental, social and corporate governance, including climate change, could negatively affect Welltower’s access to capital, ability to deliver on being a thought leader within our industry, successful relationship-based investments and the Company’s ability to attract and retain the best talent. To manage this, Welltower has comprehensive employee, tenant and vendor engagement programs in place focused on operational strategies to drive energy and water efficiency. Welltower updated the Vendor Code of Conduct in 2022 to reflect and encourage its vendors to abide by our mission following best practices of environmental sustainability. Welltower also sends out a Performance Playbook to all seniors housing operators annually to reinforce the importance of everyday behavioral and operational changes that can help reduce overall energy, water and waste consumption. These efforts help to align Welltower's strong ESG commitment (and their resulting reputation in the market) with their partners and affiliated parties/vendors.
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included
We maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage, and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. We also maintain a large and geographically diversified portfolio to mitigate exposure to acute physical risks. However, some of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes and floods. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, always included
We maintain a large and geographically diversified portfolio to mitigate exposure to chronic physical risks. However, some of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by longer-term shifts in weather patterns, such as heat and water stress. Therefore, we have taken extra steps to limit the impact of these longer-term changes in the climate, such as retrofitting cool roofs on some of our properties or upgrading HVAC systems on older buildings. Welltower also sends out a Performance Playbook to all seniors housing operators annually to reinforce the importance of consistent preventative maintenance efforts that help to address and mitigate the effects of chronic physical risks/stressors such as heat stress and extreme temperatures/freeze.

Company-specific description
Welltower is a REIT, and as such our portfolio consists of operational real estate. Welltower’s portfolio contains assets located in numerous states and local jurisdictions across the US (as well as Canada and the UK). Each state and local jurisdiction in the US has varying municipal benchmarking reporting requirements that must be met in order to avoid fines. For example, in the state of California, non-residential properties which individually or together are 50,000 sq. ft or greater, are required to annually submit their benchmarking report for property energy usage. For this reason, Welltower works with a third-party consultant to run Building Performance Standards (BPS) and compliance reports on all local and state regulations that may affect certain assets in that state. Welltower communicates with Operators to gather the needed benchmarking data by the deadline to avoid any fines and keep all of our assets in compliance.

Explanation of financial impact figure
Welltower undertook an exercise with third-party consultants to assess each property from the Welltower asset list located in North America to flag any properties in a jurisdiction with a current or upcoming benchmarking requirement. The potential financial impact of up to ~$9,185,000 was calculated based on the total of the maximum fine for each benchmarking requirement per year or 30 days of non-compliance for properties in jurisdictions with daily fines (based on the assumption that properties are incentivized to address issues of non-compliance sooner with a daily late fee). For example, in the state of California non-residential properties which singly or together are 50,000 sq. ft or greater are required to annually submit their benchmarking report for property energy usage. Failure to comply could potentially result in over tens of thousands of dollars in fines for that one property.
Cost of response to risk
42140
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
To minimize the potential financial impact of non-compliance with municipal reporting requirements, Welltower consistently works with third-party consultants to monitor and assess the municipal reporting requirements for each property, notifies property operators of requirements and assists in submitting the required information to avoid potential fines. Welltower engaged a third-party consultant to assist with these efforts through a fixed $35,000 engagement fee. Welltower’s ESG Analyst also supports these efforts, committing a general estimate of ~140 hours over the course of the year at a general estimated hourly cost rate of ~$51. Welltower is not able to accurately capture time and costs spent by operators and the MOB team to fulfill these reporting requirements. Therefore, the cost of Welltower’s response to the risk of enhanced emissions reporting obligations is calculated by:

Third-party consultant fee ($35,000) + ESG Analyst support (140 hours x $51/hour) = $35,000 + $7,140 = $42,140

Company-specific description
Welltower is a REIT, and as such, our portfolio consists of operating real estate. Weather extremes such as flooding could result in loss of property and damage to properties. Change in rainfall conditions, size and frequency of possible floods could result in damage and/or loss of property, compromise infrastructure and create operational interruptions. Based on our most recent Moody's Climate Change Scenario Analysis (detailed on pages 38-41 of our 2022 ESG Report), Welltower's current portfolio has low financial risk exposure and low geographic risk exposure to flooding. In order to protect itself from the financial impacts of flooding, Welltower has a comprehensive insurance policy in place to protect its property portfolio. Therefore, if one or a number of Welltower’s properties were damaged by flood events, the insurance policy in place would allow the property to be repaired and the value of Welltower’s property portfolio to not be significantly impacted.

Explanation of financial impact figure
0-30% of the total portfolio, measured by in-place NOI, is exposed to high frequency and/or severe rainfall or riverine flooding during a 100-year flood event, making up 0-30% of total portfolio sq. ft. The minimum potential financial impact figure is calculated by multiplying 4Q22 in-place NOI by the smallest % of properties at high risk of flooding (0*$ 2,012,491,340/4 = $0.00). The maximum impact figure is calculated by the largest % of properties at high risk of flooding (0.3*$ 2,012,491,340/4 = $150,936,850.50). If flooding were to occur, the financial impact from loss of NOI could fall within this range. However, Welltower maintains a large and well diversified portfolio as well as comprehensive insurance coverage with near zero probability of recognizing the maximum financial impact figure calculated.

We maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods, as well as the effects of climate change. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including, but not limited to, the costs associated with evacuation. The $16,245,000 represents insurance costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to our captive insurance company formed as of July 1, 2020, which acts as a direct insurer of property level insurance coverage for our portfolio.

Company-specific description
Welltower is a REIT, and as such, our portfolio consists of operating real estate. Weather extremes such as wildfires could result in loss of property and damage to properties. Changes in fire potential and wildfire potential could result in property damage, permanent loss of property value, stress on human health and ecosystem services, business interruptions, increased costs and reduced insurance coverages. Based on our most recent Moody's Climate Change Scenario Analysis (detailed on pages 38-41 of our 2022 ESG Report), Welltower's current portfolio has low financial risk exposure and medium geographic risk exposure to wildfires. In order to protect itself from the financial impacts of wildfires, Welltower has a comprehensive insurance policy in place to protect its property portfolio. Therefore, if one or a number of Welltower’s properties were damaged by wildfires, the insurance policy in place would allow the property to be repaired and the value of Welltower’s property portfolio to not be significantly impacted.

Change in water supply and demand can increase water cost, erode social license to operate and/or damage Welltower properties’ reputation. As a result, there is an opportunity to increase water efficiency throughout Welltower’s portfolio through efficiency upgrades. Based on our most recent Climate Change Scenario Analysis (detailed on pages 38-41 of our 2022 ESG Report), 30-60% of 4Q22 IPNOI and pro rata square feet has potential financial and geographic exposure to areas where competition for water resources is high. The majority of our higher risk exposure is in California and Texas. In the analysis, risk exposures were grouped into three ranges including less than 30%, 30-60%, and over 60% exposure.

Explanation of financial impact figure
The potential financial impact reflects the savings realized by upgrading to more water efficient equipment. As an example, Welltower’s OM team piloted an irrigation management system that resulted in over $16k in operational cost savings across five properties and between 38-88% reduction in water usage in 2022. Welltower plans to roll out the irrigation management system to at least 10 additional properties in 2023, including six properties already identified in Texas, Georgia, and California. Based on cost savings estimates, if rolled out to 10 additional properties, this initiative could result in operational cost savings of ~$121,560 per year (15 properties x $675 average monthly savings x 12 months = $121,560 per year cost savings). Welltower engages in numerous other water efficiency practices in addition to the new irrigation management system, which have additional potential financial impacts.

Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
Welltower’s water usage is primarily made up of domestic water and irrigation. Our water conservation efforts include benchmarking usage and monitoring usage trends, utilizing low-flow and high-efficiency fixtures and equipment, installing leak detection technology that will alert staff to high usage or slow leaks, installing drip irrigation systems, planting drought tolerant landscaping and aiding in the water management efforts of our partners outside of our operational control. This year, Welltower has facilitated procurement of ENERGY STAR and other water efficient appliances for its communities and assisted operators in capex budgeting and planning, inclusive of our irrigation management system pilot. Rollout of the irrigation management system across 15 properties would have an annual estimated cost of approximately $21,360.

Inefficient and outdated lighting fixtures can increase energy costs and decrease quality of life for our tenants and residents. As a result, there is an opportunity to increase energy efficiency and improve lighting quality throughout Welltower’s portfolio by installing LED lighting. With a focus on increasing lumens when necessary, eliminating shadowing and putting the right color temperatures in the right spaces, upgrading lighting to LED fixtures has the potential to not only reduce costs and our environmental footprint, but also to improve the daily lives of our senior living residents and visitors in our outpatient medical facilities.

Welltower works with supplier and partner Greenleaf Energy Solutions to facilitate LED retrofit projects. The cost to realize this opportunity was calculated by totaling our project costs from 2013 to date. As an example, Greenleaf helped Welltower identify a senior living community in Jackson, NJ as a property that could significantly benefit from the program, as it had outdated lighting fixtures and would be able to take advantage of numerous incentives. In 2022, Greenleaf and Welltower worked together to upgrade the lighting throughout the community’s facilities to LED fixtures. With incentives, the final cost of installing the new lighting fixtures at the community was approximately $96,000, and the upgraded lighting will generate over $18,000 in annual operational cost savings.

The methodology used characterizes physical climate hazards that are important drivers of business risk: floods, heat stress, hurricanes & typhoons, sea level rise, water stress and wildfires. The methodology is data driven to quantify the risks to then develop qualitative statements.

RCP 8.5 is used because we believe this scenario is the most valid for business purposes because any potential policy actions will not have a discernible impact on climate change until after 2050 and impacts between emission pathways do not significantly vary within this time frame.

Each physical and transition risk is assessed for short-, medium- and long-term impact based on likelihood for it to occur within the chosen timeframe. Our most recent climate change scenario analysis can be found on pages 38-41 in Welltower's 2022 ESG Report.
C3.2b
(C3.2b) Provide details of the focal questions your organization seeks to address by using climate-related scenario analysis, and summarize the results with respect to these questions.
Row 1
Focal questions
Welltower recognizes that climate-related events could impact our portfolio. In order to identify and implement appropriate preventative measures throughout our portfolio, we chose to focus on the two questions below when performing our climate-related scenario analysis. Focusing on these two questions allowed us to better understand which of our properties are at the greatest risk of climate-related events, where we may be lacking adequate insurance coverage, and where there may be opportunities to take preventative measures. Also, by using the RCP 8.5 scenario, it allowed for the worst-case scenario operational impacts to be analyzed and help drive change and investment where it is needed most.

1. Which properties are most susceptible to the following climate risks: heat stress, water stress, wildfires, floods, hurricanes & typhoons and sea level rise?

2. Do we have adequate insurance coverage or are there other preventive measures we could put in place to prevent property damage and loss before these extreme weather events occur?
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
1. As a result of the analysis, Welltower was able to identify which properties are in the highest risk areas for these climate-related events and quantify both financial and geographic exposure. Financial exposure was measured as a percentage of 4Q22 in-place NOI, while geographic exposure was measured as a percentage of pro rata square feet owned as of 4Q22. Exposure was grouped into three categories: Low: less than 30%; Medium: 30-60%; and High: greater than 60%. Due to the large size and diversification of our portfolio, the financial and geographic exposure to heat stress, floods, hurricanes and typhoons, and sea level rise is low, while financial and geographic exposure to wildfires is low and medium (respectively) and both financial and geographic exposure to water stress is medium. Welltower considers transitional risks such as regulatory changes, technology upgrades and reputational risks to be portfolio-wide risks.

2. The results of our analysis were shared with our Risk Committee, and we have been performing additional analyses to compare certain insurance coverages, mainly related to flooding, with our climate analysis findings. As a result, Welltower has looked at other risk exposures, including heat and water stress, to prioritize efficiency projects across the portfolio, such as installing efficient irrigation systems to reduce water usage and installing cool roofing systems to 1) reduce heat transfer, 2) optimize HVAC run times, 3) improve occupant comfort and 4) reduce heat island effect.
C3.3
(C3.3) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your strategy.
Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
Due to increasing energy efficiency compliance legislation across the country, Welltower has incorporated a budget for third-party consultants to assist with compliance to help ensure all properties meet requirements and avoid any related fines. Some of Welltower's facilities are in jurisdictions that have introduced climate change and energy related ordinances, such as energy benchmarking and disclosure ordinances. 194 Welltower-owned properties were impacted by these ordinances in 2022, which potentially include fines for non-compliance. Cost and impact of compliance were minimal during the reporting period.

In addition, there is reputational risk for buildings with less optimal energy efficiency initiatives and performance. This could potentially cause tenants to leave or impact Welltower's ability to attract new tenants, which could lead to a decrease in occupancy at those properties. Consequently, in these markets with municipal benchmarking regulations or building performance standards, as well as other major markets across the country, we expect tenants to seek "green" and/or efficient buildings.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
During extreme weather events, some vendors may not be able to provide the goods and services that Welltower needs. This creates a significant risk if Welltower is not able to have buildings back up and running quickly to minimize tenant downtime and mitigate the inherent risk of potentially losing tenants. To mitigate this risk, Welltower has identified alternative providers in the event that the primary provider is unavailable. In addition, Welltower has preferred contracts in place with vendors to help to ensure that we have priority to access goods should there be an issue with our supply chain as a result of a weather event. In the reporting period, one example of crisis/emergency management is contracting with third-party restoration vendors in Texas and Florida. Some of Welltower's properties in Southern United States were adversely affected by the extreme weather events that caused the Texas power crisis. Fortunately, the risk of unexpected power outages due to extreme weather had influenced our strategy and our sites were prepared for this and had on-site generators. Welltower is continuing to use these generators and will bring more on-site in the long-term as the likelihood of extreme weather events continues.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
Welltower's R&D activities are centered around piloting new and emerging technologies that reduce energy and water use and greenhouse gas emissions, while creating value for the asset and its occupants. These activities are at risk if discretionary funds are not available due to reduced occupancy or must be diverted to other unexpected expenses due to climate-related events in the short-medium term. This, however, did not impact the business during the reporting period.

Welltower is also investing in certifying many of its new developments with LEED, IREM, or BREEAM and has started to assess and/or pursue other certifications including WELL and Fitwel.
Operations	
Yes
Extreme weather events can disrupt operations. Welltower's properties have measures and procedures in place aimed at ensuring that operations return to normal quickly after disruptive events. Welltower has preferred contracts in place with vendors to help to ensure that we have priority to access goods should there be an issue with our supply chain as a result of a weather event. One example of crisis/emergency management is contracting with national third-party restoration vendors. In the reporting period, some of Welltower's properties, with a heavier concentration in Texas and Florida, were adversely affected by extreme weather events. Fortunately, the risk of unexpected power outages due to extreme weather had influenced our strategy and our sites were prepared for this and had on-site generators. Welltower is continuing to use these generators and will bring more on-site in the long-term as the likelihood of extreme weather events continues. Welltower also has a robust third-party engineering inspection program in-place to help provide recommendations and customize loss prevention measures at each property. Between 100-150 properties are inspected annually as part of this program.

Capital expenditures
Access to capital
Assets
Liabilities
Earnings may be impacted in the long term due to significant increases in property insurance costs from the physical impacts of climate change and/or requirements to implement energy-efficiency measures from local jurisdictions that are outside of the general Welltower capital investment process.

Welltower invests capital each year in measures that reduce consumption and costs across the portfolio, such as the LED retrofit program, which supports operational cost savings with a return on investment of under five years. We treat energy as a controllable expense resulting in our active management and negotiation of energy rates and considerable efforts to reduce our environmental impact through the procurement of renewable energy.

Welltower dedicates capital investment in its portfolio year after year to reduce consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and costs. For example, over $37M in capital has been spent on 391 LED retrofit projects to date. Over the last two years, capital expenditure has been consistent and climate change has only had a minimal impact. Looking forward, we expect this to be the same in the short term.

For example, one of Welltower's developments in the United Kingdom, Wandsworth Common, includes low carbon technologies such as combined heat and power units, photovoltaic roof panels and energy efficient technologies such as motion-sensor lighting. This is expected to lead to savings of 89 tons (35%) of regulated CO2 annually.

Another example is The Apsley, a recently opened redevelopment project located in the Upper West Side of NYC. This project made use of an existing space, reduced demand on raw materials, and did not contribute to urban sprawl or infringe on undeveloped areas. The Apsley is pursuing LEED and WELL certification and features many sustainable design elements. A life cycle assessment conducted in 2022 determined that the sustainable materials used in the building's structure and envelope could result in a 24% savings in kg CO2e of embodied carbon compared to a baseline model (total savings of 1269715.54 kg CO2e).

It is expected that investors will start to expect more climate change disclosure and will consider this in their decisions in the short-medium term. Welltower also sees opportunities in improving its reputation and environmental performance. For example, Welltower was the first U.S. health care REIT to successfully complete a public green bond offering of a $500 million, 7-Year Note at 2.7% due in 2027. Demand was 7.0x oversubscribed and WELL’s lowest coupon on a 7-year note. In March 2022, Welltower issued a second green bond of $550 million of 3.85% senior unsecured notes due 2032.

Some of our assets are geographically more at risk than others from the effects of climate change, therefore we adhere to annual property insurance modelling to assess climate related risk which may increase premiums in the long-term. Additionally, the assets located in mandatory compliance jurisdictions may have to include additional compliance processes and implementation costs in financial plans in order to review and report required metrics, especially where this information is publicly reported. Impacts of climate-related issues have had a minimal impact on this process in the reporting period.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
All properties owned by Welltower throughout the entirety (or a portion) of calendar year 2022 are included in the entity's reporting boundaries and portfolio composition for this reporting year. Loans (0% ownership), properties under construction and land are excluded from the asset list and are outside of the reporting boundaries for Welltower.

This target applies to the control boundary. Welltower defines its control boundary using the financial control approach. Under this approach, medical office buildings that are directly managed by Welltower and seniors housing operating properties in Welltower’s portfolio are included within the control boundary (Scope 1 and 2), with triple-net properties considered outside of the financial control boundary and included in Scope 3. An inventory management plan (IMP) was developed and describes the data sources and methodology used to prepare Welltower’s 2022 greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. Both the IMP and an accompanying GHG inventory are created in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) guidance and best practices for calculation of emissions associated with Direct Emissions from Stationary Combustion Sources and Indirect Emissions from Purchased Electricity.

Regarding the question about relating to "% change anticipated in absolute Scope 1+2 emissions," Welltower has estimated a change of 159% from the base year (2018) to the target year (2025). Our data coverage continues to increase each year, so while our intensity decreases, our portfolio size changes and our access to data improves. Assuming a 20% increase in data coverage each year, we estimate a 159% change in absolute Scope 1+2 emissions by 2025 from a 2018 baseline.

Welltower works with supplier and partner Greenleaf Energy Solutions to facilitate LED retrofit projects across its portfolio. Welltower has completed 391 total LED retrofit projects as of 12/31/2022 and has invested over $37 million in our LED retrofit program, generating an average return on investment of our LED retrofit projects of less than 5 years. In 2022, Greenleaf and Welltower worked together to upgrade lighting fixtures to LED fixtures at 9 different properties, which have been estimated to have an annual savings of 432 metric tonnes CO2e. With incentives, the final cost of installing the new lighting fixtures at the communities was $1,207,825, and the upgraded lighting will generate over $106,501 in annual operational cost savings. As of 12/31/2022, Welltower has commenced implementation of LED retrofits at 3 additional properties, which are estimated to have an annual savings of 342 metric tonnes CO2e.

A proposal was received and is under investigation for a pilot project: to lease roof space on 12 CA properties to install solar PV arrays and provide RECs to Welltower. The proposal projects a total of $14M in annual energy savings over 20 years. Combined, the 12 properties' systems would total 5,297 kW and produce 8,450 MWh/year, for a total annual emissions savings of approximately 1,927 metric tonnes. There is no upfront cost to Welltower.

(C4.3c) What methods do you use to drive investment in emissions reduction activities?
Method	Comment
Financial optimization calculations
As part of an effort during the capital budget planning process, Welltower identifies opportunities to implement energy reduction measures that would impact emissions reduction. Welltower utilizes financial operational cost calculations to determine the viability of energy/emission reduction initiatives.
Internal incentives/recognition programs
Internal incentives promote and reward the environmentally conscious business practices of Welltower through our NEO’s short term incentive goals which include specific targets related to progress towards our public GHG, energy and water reduction goals and goals related to our publicly reported climate related disclosures.
Employee engagement
Welltower conducted employee engagement programs throughout the reporting year aimed at educating and encouraging employees to reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint. For example, the ESG team shared a learning module and challenge to all Welltower employees to “Protect Our Planet" for Earth Day 2022. In addition, the ESG team regularly participates in Welltower's Department Speaker Series for new and existing employees to educate them on sustainability and the work of the ESG team.

For the outpatient medical portfolio, where Welltower has operational control, the ESG team is consistently communicating with property managers and maintenance teams to discuss sustainability initiatives in place, results and the potential for additional efficiency programs at our properties.

Since becoming the first U.S. health care REIT to successfully complete a public green bond offering in December 2019 for $500M and subsequently issuing a second green bond in March 2022 for $550M in accordance with Green Bond Principles of the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA), Welltower has begun expanding green bond projects with a lower carbon footprint from the offerings' net proceeds in order to add sustainable value across the portfolio. Our Green Bond Allocation Report on proceeds utilized includes projects such as financing or refinancing properties which are anticipating high-level green building certifications such as LEED, IREM, WELL, BREEAM and ENERGY STAR and could also include proceeds on energy and water efficiency upgrades designed to have 25% or higher efficiency gain, including LED lighting, HVAC and chiller replacements, irrigation systems and installation of low-flow fixtures. Issuing green bonds represents an opportunity to tap into a new and growing source of financing to further efforts to obtain green certifications for properties within our portfolio. As of 9/30/2022, Welltower has allocated $572,090 in proceeds to eligible projects that promote and contribute to our use of low-carbon goods.

Explain why this source is excluded
Fugitive emissions from refrigerants are considered immaterial as estimated emissions from this source are below the 5% materiality threshold. At this time, the data needed to calculate fugitive emissions from refrigerants is not accessible.
Explain how you estimated the percentage of emissions this excluded source represents
A benchmarking approach was used to estimate refrigerant emissions based on an available inventory of HVAC equipment at a subset of properties. Then, the information from these assets was extrapolated to the remaining portfolio. To estimate emissions, the US EPA’s Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Equipment Screening was utilized, using the benchmarked data as inputs. Based on this process, Scope 1 fugitive emissions from refrigerants were estimated to be on the order of 6,031 MTCO2e in 2019. When comparing this estimation to both 2019 Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 2022 Scope 1 and 2 emissions, refrigerant emissions are around 1% of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions and therefore deemed immaterial.
o 2019: 6,031 MTCO2e / 506,332 MTCO2e * 100 = 1%
o 2022: 6,031 MTCO2e / 623,150 MTCO2e * 100 = 1%

Emissions cover waste data collected from 20% of properties in the portfolio. Welltower employs a third-party vendor to compile data on actual waste streams from locations serviced by waste haulers directly. We then calculate waste emissions utilizing the EPA’s 2023 emission factors for waste. The EPA emission factors account for emissions from the transportation and processing of waste but do not account for any avoided emissions. Emissions generated from both landfill and diverted (recycled and composted) waste are included in this category.

Please explain
Welltower receives utility data that covers approximately 82% of calculated emissions for its downstream leased assets portfolio, which includes NNN assets. Portfolio average intensity factors based on portfolio type and region are calculated and applied to sites where data was unavailable. Welltower gathers energy usage data from our operating partners to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from downstream leased assets that fall outside of Welltower's financial control boundary (NNN assets). Welltower uses the GHG Protocol standards to calculate emissions from electricity and fuel consumption at these sites using EPA eGRID emission factors and the Climate Registry emission factors, where appropriate. Where data is not available, Welltower uses average energy intensity factors based on portfolio type and region to estimate usage and greenhouse gas emissions from these sites.

Investment in low-carbon R&D	Comment
Row 1	
Yes
In 2022, Welltower invested in a contract with Arup to provide a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) of twelve technologies at one of Welltower's properties. The LCCA was conducted to better understand the costs associated with suggested energy and water conservation measures. These costs included the social cost of carbon, which factored in the economic harm from the impacts, of the total damages from emitting one ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Battery energy storage, renewable energy and other low-carbon options were evaluated in this analysis. After thorough research was conducted to identify innovative solutions for Welltower, Arup provided recommendations to Welltower's ESG and development teams considering next steps for implementation. In addition, Arup developed an LCCA tool for Welltower to use for future developments based on the findings of their initial analysis. Finally, Arup evaluated multiple green building certification frameworks including LEED and BREEAM to develop a comprehensive Sustainability Guideline for New Development Projects, which Welltower has begun piloting at several development projects.

Welltower has a public goal to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity 10% by 2025 over a 2018 baseline.  As of the end of 2022, Welltower had exceeded this goal with a 12.2%  intensity reduction. In 2022, Welltower set a new target with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Through SBTi, Welltower has committed to a 28% reduction of absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2030 over a 2019 baseline and to continue measuring and reducing our Scope 3 emissions. In order to meet these goals, Welltower will continue to identify opportunities to construct new buildings to LEED and BREAAM building standards to lower our carbon footprint, including our Balfour at Brookline development which is targeting LEED Gold. In our existing portfolio, we will continue to implement energy efficiency projects and look into purchasing additional renewable energy.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Welltower engages with top suppliers to understand sustainable practices and how they relate to Welltower's procurement of goods and services. Of our top 50 suppliers by spend, 12 were engaged with on specific sustainability matters (1% of total supplier count, 32% of total spend). In addition, Welltower expects its vendors, operators, tenants, contractors, consultants and other business associates (collectively “Vendors”) to adopt the practices outlined in its Vendor Code of Conduct (the “Code of Conduct”). As a general matter, Welltower’s commercial agreements with Vendors require that they adhere to the Code of Conduct. Welltower's Vendor Code of Conduct specifies: "Welltower is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and reducing Welltower’s environmental impact. Welltower encourages its Vendors to assist in this mission by following best practices of environmental sustainability, including, but not limited to, energy and water efficiency, greenhouse gas (GHG) and waste reduction and green technology implementation. Welltower encourages its Vendors to set GHG emission reduction targets, track energy usage and promote and utilize renewable energy sources when possible. Refer to https://welltower.com/esg/environment/ for the Company’s initiatives, goals and achievements related to environmental sustainability."
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Success for engagement with our suppliers is understanding their sustainable practices, products and service offerings and working to increase our sustainable goods and services purchases. Welltower engaged with suppliers that resulted in the procurement of green energy, improving the resiliency of our portfolio against climate change and the issuance of green bonds. In addition, through a partnership for our operators with HD Supply, Welltower properties purchased over $1.2M in sustainable building supplies in 2022 (up from $238k in 2021), representing approximately 4% of our spend with the vendor.

(C12.1d) Give details of your climate-related engagement strategy with other partners in the value chain.
Welltower works together with both internal and external stakeholders to seek to understand and implement the most effective engagement strategies that meet the expectations and needs of each unique stakeholder group. Each of the stakeholders we engage may have influence over our long-term success or a vested interest in the work we do. We engage with our stakeholders year-round through our ESG website, annual ESG Report, financial data and reports, social media communications, press releases, meetings, and most recently, our Vendor Code of Conduct policy. 
 

i. Methods of engagement: Welltower plans and tracks stakeholder engagement through several channels, including internal employee communication platforms, public filings, informal face-to-face discussions, formal meetings with the investment community, tenant and operator engagement surveys, and more. See section v. for more details on how we engage with each of our stakeholder groups.

  

ii. Prioritization: Welltower prioritizes engagement with the most vital parts of our value chain--our operators and tenants--starting with areas where we have operational control and operators that allow for the most significant impact. We work with our operators and medical office building staff to gather utility data, benchmark our properties, and implement efficiency measures. Welltower also prioritizes engagement with our employees, recognizing that we cannot achieve our environmental goals without the support of all departments and teams throughout our organization. 

  

iii. Measurement of success: Success is measured by several different factors, including the number of stakeholders approached, the amount of sustainability data gathered throughout the year, the response rate to engagement and satisfaction surveys, and the number of efficiency measures implemented. Success is also measured by benchmarking sites’ energy, water, and waste data across the portfolio.



iv. Vendor Code of Conduct: Welltower is committed to operating in an ethical, responsible, transparent, and sustainable manner across all of its vendors to embed our ESG goals into our value chain. We expect our vendors to commit to our policies to promote an overall transparent and ethical value chain for each party involved.

We are proud to have achieved our Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions reduction goal ahead of schedule (10% intensity reduction by 2025 over a 2018 baseline) and we are excited to take steps towards our newly established science-based target (28% absolute Scope  1 & 2 reduction by 2030 over a 2019 baseline). In addition to the carbon reduction activities mentioned in this questionnaire, we wanted to provide a little bit more context around our water reduction goals, waste initiatives, and green building and new construction priorities. 



Welltower has a publicly-stated water reduction goal: 10% water usage intensity reduction within Welltower's control boundary by 2025 over a 2018 baseline. In 2022, the following new initiatives to reduce water usage or support water quality were implemented or maintained at some of our communities:



1) Installed wireless, underground soil sensors that communicate with irrigation systems to improve efficiency of watering. The project was piloted at an outpatient medical building near Atlanta, GA, and initial results are promising in terms of water conservation  and cost savings. 



2) Our teams analyzed data to determine the root causes of plumbing leaks, potential solutions and properties that would best benefit from leak detection systems. Nine properties were identified for pilot locations. Early leak detection conserves water and reduces costs associated with water consumption and leak damage. 



We also focus on reducing waste generation and diverting waste from landfills where possible. We track waste generation and diversion rates (e.g., recycling) and monitor our progress over time. In 2022, we diverted 19%, or 10,025 tons, of waste from landfills. We are proud that 20% of our portfolio is able to report waste data.



In 2022, we partnered with CircleIT, a carbon-neutral logistics organization, to reduce e-waste. CircleIT repurposes laptops with remaining useful life and keeps them out of the landfill. When equipment is not fit to be repaired and sold, the components are to be recycled responsibly. Another diversion highlight comes from our policies guiding construction practices. 



Additionally, waste generated from construction, demolition and tenant space improvements is to be minimized and diverted from landfills where feasible. Projects with greater than 50% of area being demolished must include a waste management plan that demonstrates diversion of 75% of construction waste. 



Lastly, in working with our operators and development partners to build state-of-the-art facilities, our teams are reducing the environmental impact and increasing health and wellness for occupants associated with our buildings. In 2022,  Welltower had 58 ENERGY STAR Certified properties, 8 LEED certified properties, 1 WELL certified property, 19 IREM Certified Sustainable Properties, and 45 properties with Energy Performance Certificate grades of B or above. In addition, Welltower developed new Sustainability Guidelines for New Development Projects in order to provide guidance to consistently incorporate sustainability, health and wellness into our projects.
