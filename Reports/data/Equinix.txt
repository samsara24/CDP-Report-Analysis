C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
  

Any change in business, operations, revenue or expenditure that would prompt disclosure in other company filings (e.g. 10-K) may be considered financially substantive for the purposes of CDP disclosures. This applies to both our supply chain and direct operations.  Equinix defines substantive strategic impact in the context of climate-related risks, as impact that is more variable and uncertain over a longer time frame than is typically considered for financial risk. The majority of disclosures in this report meet the conceptual definition of substantive strategic impact rather than substantive financial impact. 

From a quantitative standpoint, Equinix considers a five-point impact scale to categorize impact of any risk event. Impact is defined as the effect of an event on the enterprise’s ability to generate revenue and achieve strategic objectives. A climate-related risk is defined to be strategically and financially substantive if it has a potential to significantly impact the company’s operating results i.e. more than 10% of operating income and impede achievement of the company’s strategic objective(s).

Description of process
Equinix's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Business Continuity Program (BCP) teams are responsible for identifying, prioritizing, and evaluating risks and consequences, and responding to minimize the impact of climate-related threats and risks and opportunities. Strategic, financial, operational and regulatory risks are assessed at the Enterprise level through the ERM process. The scope of the integrated risk assessment focuses on four key areas – strategic, financial, regulatory, and operational risks and pertain to direct operations, upstream impacts and downstream impacts.

To identify and assess risks at the corporate level, the ERM team conducts periodic surveys and interviews with key management and leadership across the Company including risks ranging from cyber security, to IBX outages, competition, climate-related issues around power (upstream availability, reliability, pricing), transition risk (downstream consumer preference, renewable energy policy, technological disruption) and physical risks (earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and droughts). The ERM team consolidates this information and creates a risk heat map (average likelihood vs. average impact score) that is used to assess and prioritize the top 10 risks, after which the results are shared across the executive staff and periodic updates are made at Nominating and Governance Committee meetings as well as annually to the full Board. The ERM team selects the top 5-10 risks, on which a deep dive analysis is then performed.

For the top risks, the Executive Staff Risk Owner is designated as responsible for owning and managing the risk. The Executive and/or their designee are assigned to actively manage the risk and the associated risk profile which includes the following elements: owner, designee, risk definition, risk score, velocity, mitigation capability, drivers, controls, safeguards, and mitigation measures. Additionally, risk appetite for each risk (willingness to accept, avoid, transfer) and key risk indicators (KRIs) are also defined. Risk Profiles on the top 5-10 risks are periodically reported to a sub-Committee of the Board and/or to the full Board.

In 2022, the ERM team is taking a two-phased approach to updating the key risk list. Interviews with Executive Staff and the Board will create an initial risk list that will be discussed at the full Board. That list will be utilized to perform a survey of leadership and the data collected from the two processes will be utilized to create an updated risk list. We also completed a climate risk assessment process- inclusive screening of potentially relevant climate-related risks based upon their likelihood, significance, and scope of impact across the business in the near, medium, and long term. The scope of this process was global and included both organization-wide impacts as well as asset level impacts.

To identify and assess risks at the asset (data center) level, the process begins during site selection, when natural hazard exposures are identified by the Risk Management function and considered as part of the business case for the site. This information is provided to the Real Estate team as a part of the decision criteria to select a site and then to the Design & Construction team to ensure awareness of issues unique to a particular location and potential design solutions are created to address exposures. The Business Continuity team then conducts a threat and risk assessment for each data center on an annual basis, which identifies major issues and their impact and likelihood. Risks are evaluated and scored for impact, likelihood and severity based on their potential human (i.e. death and injury), property (i.e. loss and damage), and business (i.e. loss of market share, business interruption) impact should an incident occur. Physical risks like hurricanes and floods are included in the assessment. The risk assessment is updated annually and includes risks consistent with the Global Risks Report by the World Economic Forum. This information is presented to the Business Continuity Executive Steering Committee, which includes the Global Head of Operations. A site-level risk is substantive if it receives a score of over 2.0 in the Assessment – roughly equivalent to $15,000 direct customer impact (per customer/incident) and it is evaluated for additional mitigation opportunities.

A case study of how the process is applied to a physical risk includes how Equinix’s new construction sites are designed to withstand changing climate regimes in different regions. As part of the site selection and design process, Equinix’s Global Design & Construction team assess how physical parameters such as temperature, rainfall, flooding, etc. will affect the building and inform decision around the construction and design. We conducted a hydrological and hydraulic modelling study that allowed us to evaluate the threat of flooding with possible overflows of the Bogotá River, in areas adjacent to our BG2 project. The city reported overflow of the river during a La Niña event in 2010 and 2011. As a result, the city with the help of the Regional Autonomous Corporation of Cundinamarca (CAR) carried out recovery works focused on Hydraulic Adaptation and Environmental Improvement focusing on three fundamental activities, dredging and recertification of the river, expansion of the river to obtain greater transport capacity and development of new jarillones along the bank of the river. The flow profile of the Bogotá River was analyzed and it was found to maintain a subcritical state during all flood events for Tr 100 years (return period). The hydraulic adaptation work through implementation of a dam with an elevation of the crown at 2545.50 meters above sea level had limited threat of flood due to overflow of the Bogota River in the vicinity of our BG2 property. This study was completed in 2020 before we initiated the construction of BG2 facility in 2021.

A case study of how the process is applied to a transition risk includes how Equinix progresses towards its 100% renewable energy goal. According to Equinix’s sustainability materiality assessments, failure to make progress or meet the renewable target is considered a significant business risk as it may impact our reputation as a leading data center provider in this area as it was identified that two thirds of our largest customers have their own climate commitments. As of 2022, Equinix was had 96% renewable energy coverage across our global operations. We understand and recognize the challenge in continuing to make progress to cover the remaining 4%, especially as we continue to expand and acquire new sites through M&A. Therefore, we evaluate the renewable procurement opportunities during the planning and design phases of new data center construction to ensure renewable integration is feasible.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Risks from current regulation are always included in our annual company-wide risk assessment. For example, Equinix’s 2022 Form 10-K includes current international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our operations and could increase our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions (Pages 30-31). Regulations may impact our design, operations, or provision of offerings. Violations of any domestic or international laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of business.

An example of a current regulatory risk is the EU-ETS emissions rules to which we are subject. Equinix has regional environmental compliance teams in place to ensure short and long-term compliance with all applicable carbon pricing systems. Equinix has 8 sites currently subject to EU-ETS in the UK, Ireland and France. In the reporting year, a new site has been added in the list of regulated sites which purchased 2,411 allowances and verified 2,409 allowances, thereby increasing the number of purchased and verified allowances significantly from FY 2021. Working with our consultants ensures that we conduct regular energy audits, data collection and verification, and reporting to maintain compliance with EU-ETS.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
Risks from emerging regulation are included in our annual company-wide risk assessment. For example, in Equinix’s 2022 Form 10-K, emerging regulation such as environmental regulations may impose upon us new or unexpected costs (Page 33-34). For example, regulations related to air emissions or other pollutants may lead to unexpected operational limitations on our emergency generators or additional costs for pollution control technologies. Additionally, regulation of GHG or carbon emissions (such as through carbon pricing mechanisms) could increase the cost of electricity by reducing amounts of electricity generated from fossil fuels, by requiring the use of more expensive generating methods, by requiring capture, management or reduction of GHG emissions, or by imposing taxes or fees upon electricity or GHG emissions. One such example of this is the carbon tax in Singapore.

An example of emerging regulation risk is, in the U.S., new regulations and legislation have been proposed or enacted during the current Administration that limit or otherwise seeks to discourage carbon dioxide emissions and the use of fossil fuels. Such regulations and legislation have included or may in the future include measures ranging from direct regulation of GHG emissions to "carbon taxes," and tax incentives to promote the development and use of renewable energy and otherwise lower GHG emissions. Other countries in which we operate may also impose requirements and restrictions on GHG emissions.

Technology	
Relevant, always included
Risks relating to technology are included in our annual company-wide risk assessment. We believe it is important to invest in our own technology advances related to climate opportunities as well as technologies that decrease our potential exposure to climate-related risks. We are committed to leveraging technology and innovation to encourage commercialization of solutions that will enable the “Data Center of the Future.” The Data Center of the Future will be characterized by reliability, efficiency, efficient cost to build, sustainability, and enhanced data center life.

As an example of technology risk that we are addressing, in 2021, Equinix announced the opening of our first Co-Innovation Facility (CIF) located in our DC15 IBX data center at Ashburn, Virginia campus, in the Washington D.C. area. This facility enables Equinix and innovation partners to collaborate on defining the future of digital infrastructure in data centers by testing new, more efficient and more sustainable technologies. The CIF allows us to consider customer requests by trialing new experiments in an isolated environment. Successes achieved in the CIF are then implemented in working data centers, thereby expand possibilities for our customers and suppliers to progress towards their climate goals.

Equinix has partnered with several innovative suppliers to develop prototype approaches via the CIF. These partnerships have explored liquid cooling, high-density cooling, intelligent power management and on-site prime power generation. After successfully trialing liquid cooling in the CIF, we are now provisioning liquid cooling distribution in 1-3 key metro areas.
Legal	
Relevant, always included
Legal risks are included in our annual company-wide risk assessment. At the corporate level, according to Equinix’s 2021 Form 10-K, we may be subject to securities class action and other litigation, including climate change or emissions (Page 42). Litigation can be lengthy, expensive, and divert resources, and an adverse outcome in litigation could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief. Litigation could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Equinix manages against these legal risks through a global compliance program designed to ensure our business is conducted with a high standard of ethics and that we meet or exceed all applicable local, regional, and federal regulations.

An example of a legal risk is the EU-ETS emissions rules to which we are subject. Equinix has regional environmental compliance teams in place to ensure our short and long-term compliance with all applicable carbon pricing systems. Equinix has 8 sites currently subject to EU-ETS (in the UK, Ireland and France). In the reporting year, a new site has been added in the list of regulated sites which purchased 2,411 allowances and verified 2,409 allowances, thereby increasing the number of purchased and verified allowances significantly from FY 2021. Working with our consultants ensures that we conduct regular energy audits, data collection and verification, and reporting to maintain compliance with the local application of the EU-ETS and are not subject to permit violations or fines.
Market	
Relevant, always included
Market risks are included in our annual company-wide risk assessment. As reported in Equinix’s 2022 Form 10-K, we recognize that global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty could adversely impact our business and financial condition (Page 18 & 40) and we need to maintain our ability to access capital markets (Page 18 & 40). Climate change poses both a risk and opportunity for our business model in terms of changing behavior in the markets and the investors we seek to attract.

An example of a market risk includes shifts in demand of our services. We are in a unique position to help our customers to green their digital supply chains. Our customers want to work with suppliers who can help them meet their own sustainability targets. Leveraging our 240+ data centers, we are able to use our scale to deliver global results to improve the environmental impact of both ourselves and our customers. We are also pioneering cutting edge innovations in our sites that reduce the consumption of all resources and enhance our resiliency for the future. As our customers shift to decarbonizing their supply chains, if we are not able to meet their expectations for low-carbon services, we could be at risk of lower demand and associated revenue.
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
Reputational risks are included in our company-wide risk assessment. At the corporate level, according to Equinix’s 2022 Form 10-K, we face pressures from our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders, such as the communities in which we operate, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize renewable energy procurement, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices (Page 35). There is also a risk that our ESG and sustainability objectives may not be successful. It is possible that we may not achieve our stated environmental goals in a timely manner or that our customers, stockholders or members of our communities might not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts or the speed of their adoption. Our customers, shareholders or others may object to our ESG and sustainability objectives or the manner in which we seek to achieve such objectives. Failure to act on climate change, meet our environmental goals, or significant controversy regarding these goals could harm our reputation, which would decrease our brand value and potentially impact our revenues. Conversely, acting as a leader in this space could not only have positive societal outcomes, but also strengthen our customer loyalty, improve our brand value, and increase our revenues.

An example of a reputation risk is how our customers feel about Equinix as a strategic partner. Our Sustainability Program Office (SPO) is actively training the company to be well-versed in our sustainability strategy and progress. We gather information about our reputation from customers and other stakeholders periodically through materiality assessments, surveys and ad hoc meetings. Customers are always able to provide feedback to Equinix through other channels such as sales reps, customer and NPS surveys, RFPs, and contract negotiations. At the same time, we actively work to increase our transparency around our sustainability efforts and progress through our Sustainability Report (sustainability.equinix.com), Annual Report (which has included sustainability since 2020), and through disclosures frameworks like CDP.
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included
Acute physical risks are included in our company-wide risk assessment. At the corporate level, according to Equinix’s 2022 Form 10-K, severe weather events, such as droughts, fires, flooding, heat waves, hurricanes, typhoons and winter storms, pose a threat to our IBX data centers and our customers' IT infrastructure through physical damage to facilities or equipment, power supply disruption, and long-term effects on the cost of electricity. The frequency and intensity of severe weather events are reportedly increasing as part of broader climate changes. Changes in global weather patterns may also pose long-term risks of physical impacts to our business (Page 34-35). Because our data centers are critical to many of our customers’ businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our IBX data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers.

An example of acute physical risk is our reliance on local electricity supplies to power our data centers, which in the event of an intense weather event, could experience a disruption in operations. To address this risk Equinix has developed business recovery plans (BRPs) for each of our data centers, for example, we have installed UPSs and generators to provide redundancy. Each BRP covers site-specific information about how to manage identified risks, including acute physical risks, and outlines response procedures, mitigation and recovery measures, designated suppliers and vendors, schedules, and communication methods. We also have Flood Emergency Response Plans for each data center and office that is determined to have an increased flood risk. Our insurer inspects approximately 34% of our sites each year based on value at risk and exposure and assesses the mitigation/ maintenance effectiveness.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, always included

Chronic physical risks are included in our company-wide risk assessment. At the corporate level, according to Equinix’s 2022 Form 10-K severe weather events, such as droughts, fires, flooding, heat waves, hurricanes, typhoons and winter storms may result in power supply disruption and long-term effects on the cost of electricity. Such changes, especially the extreme variability in weather pattern and increase in frequency, can impose new costs on Equinix that impact our revenue.

An example of how we address chronic physical risk that results in the volatility in the cost of electricity is the installation of 43.5 MW of Bloom Energy Fuel Cells at 17 U.S. sites in Boston, D.C., Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and New York/New Jersey. Fuel cells provided 24/7 always on power at the location the power is consumed for a fixed cost. Fuel cells provide price certainty and a long-term hedge against market volatility.

Company-specific description
According to page 52 of Equinix’s 2022 Form 10-K, electricity is a material cost in connection with our business, and an increase in the cost of electricity could adversely affect us. Energy costs from electricity purchasing are Equinix's second largest OPEX spend representing 23% of operational spend. We use electricity to power both our infrastructure and our customers' IT equipment. Equinix is exposed to changes in power prices that result from fluctuating market forces and emerging regulations on generators, transmission and distribution costs, and taxes, as well as changes in the commodities prices driven by changing global market dynamics in the coal, oil, and natural gas sectors. In order to remain competitive, we must control both our electricity demand through building and operating efficiently and mitigate potential impacts from these risks through smart power procurement strategies that consider cost, price certainty as well as carbon emissions. An example of market fluctuation due to a climate event, extreme temperature events in Japan in June 2022 indirectly impacted our facilities due to the tight supply and demand warning issued by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. Though generation of solar increased in the daytime, it plummeted during off-peak hours resulting in extremely tight reserve margin on the Tokyo electricity grid with blackouts identified as a potential risk. Equinix has 11 IBX data centers in Tokyo which represents ~4% of our footprint by electric power usage. Our local Operations teams activated the Business Continuity and Recovery Plan by ensuring all locations had full generator fuel tanks and multiple fuel supply vendors were on-standby to maintain power supply to ensure uninterrupted operations. We stayed vigilant and prepared for any indirect impacts that might occur further, whilst maintaining the highest levels of service and site resiliency. As a data center provider, reliability is of top priority to us. We always maintain an updated comprehensive Threat and Risk Assessment inclusive of risk mitigation methods. Fortunately, after the risk response plan, we determined that there was no direct or significant indirect impact towards our operations.

Explanation of financial impact figure
In 2022, Equinix spent $900 million USD on electricity or about 23% of its annual Cash OPEX of $3.89 billion; a 5% swing in power costs due to market fluctuations would mean Equinix could experience a cost increase of $45 million. Compared to total OPEX this represents about 1% of operational costs; therefore, this magnitude has been characterized as low.

Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
Equinix seeks to control both energy costs and energy usage. To stabilize and lower costs, our Global Power Procurement program seeks contracts that enable us to ensure budget certainty over the next 0-3 years while also observing the marketplace. This includes entering into fixed priced contracts, hedge structures, and/or purchasing renewable energy at fixed prices, as well as investing in fuel cells to provide resilient, cost-effective power to our sites. The cost to manage utilities at Equinix including our invoice collection, regulatory work (e.g., monitor and protect again unexpected regulation changes) and hedging strategy (to protect against market volatility and uncertainties), and contract for fuel cells. In 2022, we spent approximately $1.3 million in energy management, sustainability and renewable strategy advisory services, and data management. Therefore, in total we spent $1.3 million in 2022 (or 0.2% of the cost spent on power) for managing the market uncertainty risk.

Cost of response calculation: $1,300,000

A case study of how we responded and mitigated the market risk of energy demand and availability with our energy-generation capability and backup strategy. Extreme temperature events in Japan in June 2022 indirectly impacted our facilities due to the tight supply and demand warning issued by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. Though generation of solar increased in the daytime, it plummeted during off-peak hours resulting in extremely tight reserve margin on the Tokyo electricity grid with blackouts identified as a potential risk.

We stayed vigilant and prepared for any indirect impacts that might occur further, whilst maintaining the highest levels of service and site resiliency. In another instance, in February 2021, there was a snowstorm in Texas, where 9 of our data centers (DA1, DA2, DA3, DA4, DA6, DA7, DA9, DA11 and HO1) are located. Due to the improved power procurement strategy, we were able to avoid losses from the price spike this time in the Southwest region.

Company-specific description
According to page 34 of Equinix’s 2022 Form 10-K, emerging regulations of greenhouse gas (‘‘GHG’’) emissions could increase the cost of electricity by reducing amounts of electricity generated from fossil fuels, by requiring the use of more expensive generating methods, by requiring capture, management or reduction of GHG emissions, or by imposing taxes or fees upon electricity or GHG emissions. In the U.S., state regulations also have the potential to increase our costs of obtaining electricity to operate our data centers. Certain U.S. states in which we operate have issued or are considering and may enact environmental regulations that could materially affect our facilities and electricity costs. For example, California has limited GHG emissions from new and existing conventional power plants by imposing regulatory caps and by auctioning the rights to emission allowances. Multiple other states have issued regulations (or are considering regulations) to implement similar carbon cap and trade programs, carbon pricing programs and other mechanisms designed to limit GHG emissions.

A case study on how Equinix is driving operational efficiency is by implementing our Energy Efficiency program that concentrates on reducing energy consumption and monitoring Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) as the key metric. We have developed a four-phase programmatic approach driven by our Energy Efficiency Centre of Excellence to deliver a consistent set of actions toward PUE improvement. Equinix dedicated substantial resources to drive our operational efficiency, often supported by the proceeds of our Green Bonds. In 2022, we invested a total of $45M toward energy efficiency projects, resulting in associated annual energy consumption reduction of approximately 69,000 MWh.

According to page 3 of Equinix’s 2022 Form 10-K, any failure of our physical infrastructure, or negative impact on our ability to meet our obligations to our customers, or damage to customer infrastructure within our IBX data centers, could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial condition. Our office buildings and IBX data centers are subject to failure resulting from, and infrastructure within such IBX data centers is at risk from, numerous factors, including acute physical impacts of climate change such as extreme weather conditions, floods, or natural disasters. These could materially increase our costs of operation whether through increases in our energy use in order to maintain the temperature and internal environment of our data centers necessary for our operations; service interruptions; equipment damage; or the cost of structural modifications.

A specific example for Equinix was our exposure to extreme temperature events in Japan in June 2022 which indirectly impacted our facilities due to the tight supply and demand warning issued by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. Though generation of solar increased in the daytime, it plummeted during off-peak hours resulting in extremely tight reserve margin on the Tokyo electricity grid with blackouts identified as a potential risk.

Company-specific description
Equinix considers green bonds a valuable tool to raise capital and finance large projects that have a positive environmental impact. As of 2022, Equinix, Inc. priced a total of $4.9 billion in green bonds across four green bond offerings, making it the one of the top ten global issuer in the investment grade green bond market. The green bonds have been since invested in multiple areas of innovation including, green buildings, renewable energy, and energy efficiency to help advance the company's longstanding commitment to sustainability leadership and reducing its environmental impact. In each of the offerings a portion of the proceeds will be used to refinance our Senior Notes and a portion of the four green bond offering will be used to refinance our Term Loan Facility, which we expect to result in approximately $53 million of annual interest savings . This will further improve Equinix's weighted average cost of debt of 2.14% and extend its weighted average debt maturity of 8.4 years, as estimated for the period ending March 31, 2023.

Equinix intends to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the green bonds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed or future Eligible Green Projects, with disbursements covering project expenditures for up to two years preceding the issuance date of the green bonds and until and including the maturity date of the green bonds, including the development and redevelopment of such projects. Eligible Green Projects include categories such as green buildings, renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable water and wastewater management, waste management and clean transportation.

Equinix, Inc. priced $1.35 billion principal amount of notes its inaugural green bond offering on September 24, 2020, €1.1 billion principal amount of notes across two tranches in its second green bond offering on February 25, 2021 (or $1.34 billion upon exchange rate conversion), $1.0 billion of green bonds in its third green bond offering and $1.2 billion of Green Bonds in its fourth green bond offering. With the latest offer, Equinix has approximately $4.9 billion of green bonds issued. The green bonds have been since invested in multiple areas of innovation including, green buildings, renewable energy, and energy efficiency to help advance the company's longstanding commitment to sustainability leadership and reducing its environmental impact. The magnitude of impact is characterized as high since $4.9 billion total in green financing is greater than our annual Cash OPEX of $3.89 billion in 2022.

As a case study, Equinix has developed a Green Finance Framework based on the Green Bond Principles (GBP) and Green Loan Principles (GLP), a set of guidelines that promote transparency and integrity in, and advance the standardization of, green debt disclosures. As outlined in Equinix's Green Finance Framework, an amount equal to the net proceeds of the green bonds will be allocated to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed or future Eligible Green Projects in categories such as green buildings, renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable water and wastewater management, waste management and clean transportation that are expected to deliver benefits to Equinix and its shareholders. The Framework will increase Equinix's focus on protecting the environment and addressing global climate change through greenhouse gas emissions reductions, increasing resource efficiency and driving corporate transparency and accountability.
Since a portion of the proceeds will be used to refinance our Senior Notes and a portion of our Term Loan Facility, which we expect to result in approximately $53 million of annual interest savings, therefore the cost to realize this opportunity is $0 as it will ultimately result in a savings of future interest payments. This will further improve Equinix's weighted average cost of debt of 2.14% and extend its weighted average debt maturity of 8.4 years, as estimated for the period ending March 31, 2023

Company-specific description
As we envision the possibilities for our next 20 years, it is clear that digital transformation is reshaping nearly every industry across the globe. At the same time there is increasing concern around the source of electricity needed to power the growing IT loads of the world. As a global provider of 240+ data centers, Equinix sits at the intersection of technology trends and has a unique ability to offer low carbon data center products across the world in response to increased demand for such products and services. Equinix is providing customers data center products and services that incorporate sustainability, energy efficiency, and low-carbon renewable energy sources. In the month of March 2022, Equinix surveyed 2,900 IT global tech leaders from the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions to gain insight into key concerns around the digital transformation shift (https://www.equinix.com/content/dam/eqxcorp/en_us/documents/resources/infopapers/ip_2022_global_tech_trends_and_strategies_en.pdf). We found that 65% of IT leaders across the world responded that they will only work with IT partners who can meet key carbon reduction targets and 73% indicated that reducing their environmental impact is a priority for their organization’s technology strategy, with this feeling being strongest in the AMER region (79%).
This evidence underpins the existing, significant focus on sustainability practices within our sector. Working towards our short-term goal to reach 100% renewable energy is a powerful market differentiator that we believe will result in increased demand for our products and services. In using an Equinix data center, companies can reduce or even eliminate the carbon associated with their digital footprints. This is because Equinix has 96% renewable energy coverage for its total global footprint which includes both the IT workloads of its customers and the overhead infrastructure loads cooling the data centers. In 2022, 223 of our data centers offered 100% renewable energy coverage. Ultimately our goal is to reach 100% renewable, further enhancing the products and services we offer to our customers.

Explanation of financial impact figure
There is potential for us to increase revenue by taking advantage of trends towards increased demand for low carbon products and services. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model. According to page 52, of our 2022 Form-10K, our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of our recurring revenues or $2.63 billion. Based on the observation that as of 2022, 96% of the S&P 500 Index companies publish sustainability reports (source: Governance & Accountability Institute Survey: 2022 Sustainability Reporting in Focus) which is 4% higher than 2021, we anticipate that most of these customers have long-term sustainability goals that pertain to GHG emissions. If these customers increased their deployments by only 10% within Equinix to meet their low carbon data center needs, we would realize an increase of $263 million in annual recurring revenue or 3.6% - this was characterized as medium-low.

Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
Equinix spent roughly $32 million on renewable energy to cover 96% of its global power needs in 2022. This includes green power supply contracts, renewable energy certificates and virtual power purchase agreements (vPPA). Our 100% renewable energy goal will enable us to plan for unexpected change in fossil fuel prices and carbon pricing, and to take advantage of low-cost renewable energy as it becomes available. Equinix is working to increase our share our energy consumption from renewable sources despite organic growth or acquisitions and has dedicated renewable energy procurement team, external consulting budget, and dedicated budget renewable energy purchasing each year. The cost of management represents a ballpark figure for the cost of renewable energy globally in 2022 beyond BAU. The investments we make directly impact our customers who say that latency, execution, location, price and the availability of low-carbon or renewable energy are their top 5 priorities when selecting new colocation vendors. As we have expanded our renewable energy purchasing and global coverage, we ensure that our customers can take advantage of our low-carbon claims.

Cost of response calculation: $32,000,000 spent on renewable energy procurement

Case study: As a case study of how we maximized the business opportunity from providing low carbon services in 2022, we elevated sustainability within Equinix to its own Sustainability Program Office (SPO) which is responsible for internal and external leadership & education on the sustainability benefits of Equinix. The SPO conducted multiple trainings with sales teams to explain the sustainability benefits of our data centers and how we support our customers in meeting their own sustainability goals. For example, our customer Salesforce had a renewable energy goal of 100% by 2022. Salesforce does not own any of its own data centers and relies on colocation companies like Equinix to help meet their goals. Equinix developed customized Green Power Reports to enable our customers to be able to make renewable energy and carbon reduction claims associated with their Equinix services. Other key customers who have taken advantage of this service include: Oracle, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Kinaxis, and Workday. Our sustainability performance and partnerships with customers has led to high customer satisfaction and is expected to yield increased deployments within Equinix, generating new revenues.

Company-specific description
Equinix is a provider of colocation data center services and products. In 2022, we had 240+ sites across 32 countries. As a data center company, the cost of power (mostly electricity) is a material cost doing business and represented 23% of Equinix’s 2022 operational costs. Thus, an increase in the cost of electricity, such as what might result from carbon pricing, could adversely impact our business. Equinix is therefore focused on improving operational efficiency at our IBX facilities through implementation of energy efficiency program, utilizing renewable energy to not only reduce our carbon footprint and offer low-carbon services to our customers, but to also reduce exposure to future fossil fuel market, carbon pricing, or other regulatory schemes. Reducing our energy consumption and increasing our reliance on renewable energy will mitigate exposure to these risks and offer opportunities such as cost savings, improved reliability, and better access to energy including new generation sources.

The cost of electricity is a material part of Equinix’s operational spend. In 2022, Equinix spent $900 million USD on electricity or about 23% of its annual Cash OPEX of $3.89 billion. While it is difficult to predict the possible financial implications at this time, a 5% swing in power costs due to the addition of a carbon tax would mean Equinix could experience a cost increase of $45 million. Conversely, a 5% reduction in power costs due to switching to renewable energy sources could save $45 million. These estimates as compared to total OPEX this represent about 1% of operational costs; therefore, this magnitude has been characterized as low.

Equinix undertook a qualitative and quantitative physical climate-related scenario analysis in line with the TCFD recommendations in 2022. Four physical climate risk categories were screened in alignment with TCFD’s identified physical and transitional risk categories across short to long-term time horizon.

We completed the scenario analysis modeling against the Representative Concentration Pathways (“RCP”) Low 4.5 (2°C) and High 4.5 (2-4°C). These RCPs were used to evaluate the various climatic impacts in 2030 and 2050 “future worlds” scenarios, initially focusing on the highest priority physical risks i.e., drought and flooding. In the analysis, Equinix modeled for the likelihood, through climate model alignment, and financial implications of these risks in each scenario and time horizon. The analysis assesses the scope of possible future impact of these risks and facilitates Equinix’s understanding on how future investment can enhance its operational resilience.
The business implications were based on Equinix’s 2021 energy and water consumption, and assumptions were made on how energy costs and water costs may increase under future drought and flooding scenarios. The analysis assesses the scope of possible future impact of these risks and facilitates Equinix’s understanding how future investment can enhance its operational resilience.

Through this analysis it was found that drought and flooding risk may increase across some of Equinix’s portfolio in the RCP 4.5 (low and high) scenarios in every time horizons. It confirmed that investments in water and energy efficiency could be of strategic advantage in building our operational resilience, particularly in those sites that are vulnerable to both risks.

1.5ºC
Equinix used the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) Divergent Net Zero and Net Zero 2050 scenarios to analyze a 1.5ºC alignment scenario. The NGFS scenarios were selected due to the number of scenarios available and the robust nature of the developed scenarios, as they have been developed by central financial institutions from eight major economies and build on IPCC assessments, socioeconomic assumptions, and three different climate integrated assessment models. Through a shadow emissions price, the scenarios provide a proxy for government policy intensity, and changes in technology and consumer preferences. Using assumptions around emissions growth for Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and assuming that Equinix would be passed on cost of emissions throughout our value chain, Equinix examined our 2025 to 2040 possible carbon pricing exposure. Three different integrated assessment models (GCAM 5.3, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, and REMIND-MAgPIE 4.2) were used. NGFS pricing is driven by the Global Change Analysis Model (“GCAM”), an integrated assessment tool that represents the behavior and complex interactions between energy systems, water, agriculture and land use, economy, and climate.

(C3.2b) Provide details of the focal questions your organization seeks to address by using climate-related scenario analysis, and summarize the results with respect to these questions.
Row 1
Focal questions
How would climate-related physical risks plausibly affect Equinix data centers and what impact will it have on Equinix’s indirect operating spend?

How would climate-related transition risks plausibly impact Equinix’s data centers and how resilient is Equinix’s business strategy is to potential shifts in government policy intensity, changes in technology and shifts in consumer preferences in different climate scenarios?
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
Equinix prioritizes climate-related risks based on the scope of their impact and the risks that are within Equinix’s direct management control (first order risks). Hence, for scenario analysis, we focused on impact of highest priority physical risks i.e. (i) drought: changes in precipitation patterns leading to increase drought conditions at Equinix data centers as a portion of Equinix’s data center portfolio relies on water for cooling, and (ii) flooding: increased risk of flooding of Equinix data centers due to increased frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events increasing the risk of surface flooding, and rising sea levels and storm surge increasing the risk of coastal flooding.

Through the physical climate-related risk analysis, Equinix found that 28% of our sites will observe increased frequency of severe drought event and 24% of our sites will observe increase in extreme precipitation events and/or coastal flood events in the RCP High 4.5C scenario. These events may increase both electricity and water costs depending on the local hydropower reliance in the region for electricity generation and whether each specific facility relies on water for cooling the data center as well as potential impacts to business continuity.

Equinix conducted a transitional risk scenario analysis to evaluate Equinix’s exposure to risks driven by the global transition to a low-carbon economy. To quantify this exposure, Equinix is modeling carbon pricing exposure using the six Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios (Below 2°C, Net Zero by 2050, Delayed Transition, Divergent Net Zero, Nationally Determined Contributions, Current Policies) across Equinix specific GHG emission growth and reduction scenarios. This analysis is expected to provide an indication of how resilient our strategy is to different future carbon policy environments which are aligned to a 1.5-2° C world.

(C3.3) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your strategy.
Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
Equinix is committed to deploying best-in-class data center energy efficiency technologies, innovations and strategies for reducing energy consumption. We design, build and operate our data centers with high operational standards, and have a short-term goal of using 100% renewable energy across our global platform.

In using an Equinix data center, companies can reduce the carbon associated with their digital infrastructure footprints and access renewable energy across many more markets than feasible in isolation. We are uniquely positioned to offer low-carbon services as digital transformation continues to reshape nearly every industry across the globe. Simultaneously, in light of climate change, there is growing concern from our customers, investors and stakeholders around the source and volume of electricity needed to power the growing IT loads of the world.

Time horizons covered: Short-term

Case study: The most notable strategic decision Equinix has made in this area is to set a short-term 100% renewable energy goal for our global operations including all of our data center loads including our customers’ IT equipment. Our renewable energy goal is a powerful market differentiator that we believe will result in increased demand for Equinix’s services. Equinix has 96% renewable energy coverage for its total global footprint which includes both the IT workloads of its customers and the overhead infrastructure loads cooling the data centers. In 2022, 223 of our 240+ data centers offered 100% renewable energy. In using an Equinix data center, customers of Equinix can reduce or even eliminate the carbon associated with their digital footprints.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
Equinix designs, builds, and operates data centers globally. Our supply chain primarily consists of the construction materials and utilities needed to provide the space, power and cooling that we sell to our customers. Climate-related risks and opportunities have the ability to heavily impact our supply chain resilience and we recognize the importance of collecting our key suppliers’ ESG and climate data, and incorporating emission reductions target in our supply chain in addition to assessing physical risks. In 2021, Equinix set a near-term science-based target (SBT) which includes engaging with suppliers representing 66% of our Scope 3 emissions, in the categories of Purchased Goods and Services and Capital Goods, to set their SBTs by 2025.

Time horizons covered: Short, medium and long term

Case study: The most notable strategic decision Equinix made which is influencing our supply chain strategy is our SBT aligned commitment to engage with suppliers representing 66% of our Scope 3 emissions, in the categories of Purchased Goods and Services and Capital Goods, to set their SBTs by 2025. As a progress, in 2021, we launched formal ESG risk assessments for 100% of our Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. We have assessed our Tier 1 and 2 suppliers for ESG risks, inclusive of climate and identified a significant number of suppliers with high climate risk. Further, the risk assessment guides our supplier related SBT commitment to ensure our critical suppliers adopt and implement climate related policy for their business and their suppliers, maintain a complete GHG inventory, and work toward setting appropriate Science Based Targets for their business by 2025.

Investment in R&D	
Yes
Our CTO Office, Design and Construction Team, CIO Office, and Operations teams conduct R&D on which innovations, technologies, infrastructure changes and process improvements will be best suited to meet the evolving needs of our data centers due to climate change—for example, changing temperature or climate regimes or extreme weather patterns in different regions. Our mechanical and electrical engineers are regularly exploring new technologies and schemes to implement to drive cost savings and enhance reliability or resiliency.

Time horizons covered: Short and medium-term

Case study: Fluctuating customer demand and escalating energy costs can make managing infrastructure in real-time for the optimal efficiency of a data center a daunting task. But these complicating factors make the perfect use case for machine learning – an artificial intelligence (AI) approach that enables machines to independently learn, test and apply their knowledge. The knowledge generated can then be used for the benefit of data center optimization with minimum human input. At Equinix we have developed a SaaS platform called IBX SmartView that monitors electrical and mechanical infrastructure within the data centers and utilizes machine-learning to help us keep our equipment operating at its optimal levels. This development is the most notable strategic decision we have made in the R&D area.
In January 2022, announced our Co-Innovation Facility (CIF) at our campus in Ashburn, Virginia. Sustainable innovations, including liquid cooling, high-density cooling, intelligent power management and on-site prime power generation, are being explored in the CIF in partnership with leading data center technology innovators.
Operations	
Yes
As a data center builder, owner and operator, we have a substantial focus on operations. In 2022, Equinix spent $900 million USD on electricity or about 23% of its annual Cash OPEX of $3.89 billion. The cost of electricity is a material part of Equinix’s operational spend. Emerging regulations related to greenhouse gas at the local, state or national level in the form of taxes or fees as a result of climate change could substantially increase our cost of electricity and hence our operational costs. To mitigate the impact, Equinix changed our operational strategy to improve operational efficiency at our IBX facilities through implementation of energy efficiency program and focus on renewable energy procurement and reaching our 100% renewable energy target by 2030. In 2022, we invested a total of $45M toward energy efficiency projects, resulting in associated annual energy consumption reduction of approximately 69,000 MWh and purchased 7,430 GWh globally to cover 96% of our operational consumption in electricity.

Time horizons covered: medium and long-term

Case study: The most substantial strategic decision Equinix has made, which influenced our operational strategy is to implement our Energy Efficiency program that concentrates on reducing energy consumption and monitoring Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) as the key metric. We have developed a four-phase programmatic approach driven by our Energy Efficiency Centre of Excellence to deliver a consistent set of actions toward PUE improvement. Equinix dedicated substantial resources to drive our operational efficiency, often supported by the proceeds of our Green Bonds. In 2022, we invested a total of $45M toward energy efficiency projects, resulting in associated annual energy consumption reduction of approximately 69,000 MWh.

Climate-related risks and opportunities impact revenue because customers increasingly care about whether Equinix is protected from physical and transition risks related to climate change and can offer renewable powered data center services. We are seeing sustainability incorporated at a high level across all of our RFPs and a significant increase in the number of questions related to sustainability requirements across approximately one-third of all requests. Our decisions to offer carbon neutral data centers considers our ability to continue to attract and retain customers and generate recurring revenue. We review our annual financial planning and business strategy in the face of power prices, our renewable energy goal, and the needs of customers, and evolve our strategy and programs as new climate risk and opportunities present themselves. Time horizons covered: short and medium-term

Case study: Equinix set a short-term 100% renewable energy target to meet the increasing demand for carbon neutral services from existing and new customers, which directly impacts our revenue. Equinix has a dedicated annual budget to procure renewable energy in order to meet our goal and in 2022, Equinix invested roughly $32 million to purchase 7,430 GWh of renewable energy to cover 96% of our global operations. 223 of our data centers offered 100% renewable energy in 2022 and therefore customers can reduce their carbon footprint by using Equinix’s services – specific customers, who have used our renewable energy to support their goals, include Oracle, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Workday.

Climate-related risks and opportunities impact operating costs, and these are factored into our financial planning processes, annually and during quarterly business reviews with each country manager, and into our business strategy. Our strategy is to actively manage against energy price, reliability, and supply risk through our Global Utilities & Renewable Energy group. Page 19 of our 2022 10k details how we manage commodity price risk and closely monitor the cost of electricity at all locations. We have power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in some locations. We also procure renewable energy to mitigate climate-related risks and to protect against price volatility, future greenhouse gas regulation, and changing reputational or market risks. We manage the efficiency of our data centers through our global environmental sustainability and Energy Efficiency Programs (EEP) by monitoring Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), a data center efficiency metric on a monthly basis. Time horizons covered: medium and long-term

Climate-related risks and opportunities impact capital expenditures/capital allocation and are factored into our financial planning processes and our business strategy. We lay out capital when designing, building and operating our sites. Climate risks such as data center disruption (including hurricanes and floods) are prioritized when working with our insurers, in order to improve resiliency. Equinix takes steps to mitigate/avoid these risks through actions such as increasing floor levels above flood plains and constructing roofs designed to withstand excessive wind speeds. We have conducted a scenario analysis to assess how changing acute extreme precipitation events and rising sea levels may change our future flood risk exposure. Risks from climate influence our efficiency upgrades and retrofits. Our Global Design Standards program works to promote integrating sustainability and efficiency into global design specs. Solar PV panels for example are considered on every new build. Time horizons covered: short and medium-term

Climate-related risks and opportunities impact our acquisition and divestment strategy. Customers say that data center reliability and power availability – both related to and impacted by climate change – are some of the most important attributes of a data center provider, in addition to the availability of renewable energy. Acquisitions are included in our annual company-wide risk assessments because they expose us to potential risks, including: possible disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management’s attention, possible inability to achieve anticipated operating efficiencies (e.g. negatively impacted by climate or weather patterns) or cost savings (e.g. low availability of cost-effective renewable energy or inefficient operating conditions or standards inside the data center); and the possibility of customer dissatisfaction if we are unable to achieve levels of quality and reliably on par with past practices (e.g. inability to make RE claims). Time horizons covered: short and medium-term

Climate-related risks and opportunities may impact Equinix’s access to capital. In 2022, a Gartner survey revealed that 87% of business leaders expect to increase their organization’s investment in sustainability over the next two years. Investors are increasingly asking for sustainable strategies and reviewing Equinix’s annual GRI-compliant sustainability report for transparency and progress. Equinix responds to various inquiries from investors and index/rating agencies such as S&P CSA, MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS. To meet the increasing need in sustainable transformation and align our financing strategy with our external public-facing climate targets, to date, Equinix has issued $4.9 billion in green bonds since FY20. As we expand our global sustainability initiatives in support of our mission to design, build and operate data centers to enable a more sustainable digital world, these investments will help to propel our programs across multiple areas of innovation including green buildings, renewable energy, energy and water efficiency, waste reduction, and clean transportation. Time horizons covered: short and medium-term

Climate-related risks and opportunities impact our asset-level business strategy and financial planning. IBX data centers are physical infrastructure assets that are subject to climate-related risks, including wildfire, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters; extreme temperatures; water damage; and power loss. Any failure of our physical infrastructure or damage to customer infrastructure within our IBX data centers could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial results. Therefore, these risks are regularly monitored and evaluated annually as part of Equinix’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, mitigation measures such as Business Continuity Plans (BCP) are put in place, and regular reporting to the Nominating and Governance Committee is undertaken. Our scenario analyses of drought and flood risks across future temperature regimes and time horizons provide further understanding of which locations may have the highest climate-related risks. Time horizons covered: short and medium-term

Equinix has set a near-term science-based target (SBT) to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 50% by 2030 over a 2019 baseline using the 1.5-degree decarbonization scenario and the target was validated by the SBTi in 2021. 100% of our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are covered in this target with no exclusions. As our revenue is generated by the operations of our data centers, 100% of our revenue is covered in the entire goal period (2019-2030). Therefore, 100% of our revenue is aligned with a 1.5-degree world in the reporting year (2022), 2025 and 2030.

Equinix’s 1.5-degree world aligned low-carbon transition plan is driven by our climate-related goals including 100% renewable energy across our global portfolio by 2030, the recently announced science-based targets (SBT) and becoming climate-neutral across our operations by 2030.

Equinix partnered with an external consultant in 2020 & 2021 to develop our science-based target (SBT) to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 50% by 2030 over a 2019 baseline. This 12-year, medium-term target applies to Equinix’s global operations. The target was set using the Absolute Contraction Approach with a 1.5-degree scenario and it was approved by the SBTi in 2021.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
We plan to achieve our 1.5-degree aligned Scope 1+2 (market-based) science-based target (SBT) through our energy efficiency initiatives and renewable energy procurement efforts. These efforts combined have contributed to overall 22.6% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in 2022 from a 2019 baseline.

In 2022, we achieved a 1.46 annual average PUE, a measure of data center energy efficiency, with a 5.5% year-over-year reduction. We signed 3 wind PPAs in Finland and 5 solar PPAs in Spain, bringing total PPAs under contract to 595 MW and achieved 96% global renewable energy coverage. Beyond this, we successfully tested HVO at select sites with existing generators to enable a 90% reduction in onsite diesel emissions, installed free-cooling air-cooled chillers using natural refrigerants in new build projects in EMEA and announced our Prime Power hydrogen fuel cell project and joined the Clean Hydrogen Partnership in Milan, Italy.

Equinix invested roughly $32 million to purchase 7,430 GWh of renewable energy to cover 96% of our global operations. 223 of our data centers are offered 100% renewable energy coverage in 2022. We also increased our PPAs under long term contract by 160% since 2021.

Equinix has a 100% renewable energy goal across our global operations by 2030. This equates to achieving a 100% reduction in Scope 2 market-based emissions originating from electric power over a 2015 base year (766,000 mtCO2e) to net zero in the future. This 16-year, medium-term target applies to Equinix’s global operations. Within Scope 2, Equinix utilizes 98% electric power and 2% chilled water, thus the percentage of Scope 2 emissions covered by our goal is 98%. Equinix’s Scope 2 market-based total for 2022 was 215,106 mtCO2e (or 228,167 with chilled water) representing a 71.92% reduction or “71.92% of target achieved” since the base year of 2015.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Equinix applies four principles to our purchasing decisions toward our goal of 100% clean and renewable energy by 2030: (i) Utilize renewable and low carbon energy; (ii) Procure local sources of renewable energy where possible; (iii) Seek new or recently build generation sources and (iv) Advocate for favorable renewable energy policies and consider renewable energy availability when locating new data centers.

In 2022, 96% of Equinix’s global energy demand was covered with renewable energy. Our renewable power comes from a variety of projects and products that are certified to meet rigorous reporting and retirement standards. In alignment with our principles, we continually review our portfolio to increase the quality, locality, and additionality of our renewable energy purchases. Key focus areas include transitioning from certificates to virtual power purchasing agreements (VPPAs) where feasible and cost-effective and adding to our coverage in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2022, our renewable energy was sourced from windfarms in Oklahoma and Texas in the U.S., renewable energy certificates and local clean energy or low carbon programs in the U.S. and Brazil, certified green power from our suppliers in Europe, international certificates from renewable energy projects in countries including Brazil, China, Columbia, Finland, India, Japan, Mexico, Oman, Poland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam etc. In 2022, Equinix consumed 7,750 GWh of electricity in our data centers for both overhead infrastructure and customer IT load, an increase of 9% YOY. Of this 2022 consumption, 7,430 GWh or 96% was covered by renewable energy. Year over year, Equinix has increased our procurement of renewables by 10% on a GWh-basis.

This target applies to Equinix’s global operations. Equinix has been a member of RE100 since June 3, 2016 and we achieved our interim goal of sourcing 50% renewable energy against a 2015 baseline by 2017, one year early when we reported 56% renewable coverage in 2016. In 2022, we achieved 96% renewable coverage or 7,430 GWh out of 7,750 GWh electric power usage from renewable sources.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Equinix applies four principles to our purchasing decisions toward our goal of 100% clean and renewable energy by 2030: (i) Utilize renewable and low carbon energy; (ii) Procure local sources of renewable energy where possible; (iii) Seek new or recently build generation sources and (iv) Advocate for favorable renewable energy policies and consider renewable energy availability when locating new data centers.

In 2022, 96% of Equinix’s global energy demand was covered with renewable energy. Our renewable power comes from a variety of projects and products that are certified to meet rigorous reporting and retirement standards. In alignment with our principles, we continually review our portfolio to increase the quality, locality, and additionality of our renewable energy purchases. Key focus areas include transitioning from certificates to virtual power purchasing agreements (VPPAs) where feasible and cost-effective and adding to our coverage in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2022, our renewable energy was sourced from windfarms in Oklahoma and Texas in the U.S., renewable energy certificates and local clean energy or low carbon programs in the U.S. and Brazil, certified green power from our suppliers in Europe, international certificates from renewable energy projects in countries including Brazil, China, Columbia, Finland, India, Japan, Mexico, Oman, Poland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam etc. In 2022, Equinix consumed 7,750GWh of electricity in our data centers for both overhead infrastructure and customer IT load, an increase of 9% YOY. Of this 2022 consumption, 7,430 GWh or 96% was covered by renewable energy. Year over year, Equinix has increased our procurement of renewables by 10% on a GWh-basis.

(C4.3c) What methods do you use to drive investment in emissions reduction activities?
Method	Comment
Dedicated budget for energy efficiency
Equinix budgets money each year for energy efficiency investments (upgrades, retrofits and improvements) by our Operations teams; in addition, the company has a Center of Excellence (COE) for Energy Efficiency Program. This program also has a dedicated annual budget for deploying specific measures in select sites each year taking advantage of opportunities to optimize airflow and containment. Since 2011, we have invested more than $200 million, with millions of dollars more in execution as part of our ongoing commitment to reduce energy consumption within our data centers. Demand reduction from $45M of energy efficiency investments made in 2022 is roughly 8,200 kW annually.
Lower return on investment (ROI) specification
To drive energy and emissions reductions, Equinix has adopted more aggressive regional power usage effectiveness (PUE) design targets for new sites as well as major expansions. These targets are based on an average annual PUE at full load (with redundancy) that meets the definition for PUE. Our current targets range from 1.2-1.4 and represent an average incremental efficiency gain of 8-10%. Most of our newer data centers have exceeded these numbers with design average PUEs of 1.2 or better. Total cost of ownership for mechanical systems includes consideration of more efficient mechanical and electrical equipment on top of financial considerations.
Compliance with regulatory requirements/standards
Equinix complies with all applicable state, regional, and country regulations and engages in and participates in all relevant energy / emissions monitoring programs such as the EU-ETS, EU Energy Efficiency Directive, EU Medium and Large Combustion Plant Directives, Industrial Emissions Directive (EPR).
Dedicated budget for other emissions reduction activities
Equinix has a near-term goal to reach 100% renewable energy, and subsequently achieve zero Scope 2 market-based greenhouse gas emissions from electric power consumption. We are also committed to become climate neutral by 2030 which also covers Scope 1. We report these goals on an annual basis and have created a dedicated fund and monitor our progress against these goals.
Employee engagement
Equinix’s workforce is comprised of 60% operations employees who are tasked to drive innovation and efficiency within our data centers. Day-to-day data center operations are optimized by our operations employees and these employees also educate customers – including through signage within the data centers and brochures – on how to maximize the efficiency of their own IT deployments within Equinix data centers.

Equinix, Inc. priced a total of $4.9 billion in green bonds across four green bond offerings, making it the top ten global issuer in the investment grade green bond market as of the end of FY22. The green bonds will be used to help advance the company's longstanding commitment to sustainability leadership and reducing its environmental impact. Equinix intends to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the green bonds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed or future Eligible Green Projects, with disbursements covering project expenditures for up to two years preceding the issuance date of the green bonds and until and including the maturity date of the green bonds, including the development and redevelopment of such projects. Eligible Green Projects include categories such as green buildings, renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable water and wastewater management, waste management and clean transportation. As of 2022, $3.7B of the $4.9B in green bonds have been allocated toward eligible green projects, resulting in an annual emissions avoidance of over 600,000 mtCO2e

Explain your calculation of avoided emissions, including any assumptions
Equinix follows The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol for all GHG emissions calculations. The total avoided emissions from the green bonds are calculated based on the total carbon impacts from green buildings, renewable energy and energy efficiency:
- Greenhouse gas emissions avoided due to improved PUEs (annual): 205,100
- Greenhouse gas emissions avoided from renewable energy generation (average annual under full operation for 1 year): 389,800
- Greenhouse gas emissions avoided from demand savings (annual): 18,000
All projects included in the allocation for the Green Buildings category that obtained certifications as outlined in Equinix’s Green Finance Framework also achieved a design average annual PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) of 1.45 or below; therefore, impact metrics for the Green Buildings category focus on energy and emissions impacts from obtaining a low design average annual PUE.
The above figures represent the lifetime average annual environmental impacts from the total allocated green bonds toward green bond eligible projects in the identified categories as of June 30, 2022.

In 2022, 223 of our data centers offered 100% renewable energy which means they are net zero carbon for Scope 2 market-based emissions from electricity consumption. Equinix reports operational control to include both the overhead infrastructure energy usage as well as the energy usage associated with our customers’ deployments of IT equipment inside our data centers. Thus, most of our 10,000 customers can claim carbon-neutral data center services any of our net zero data centers by applying a CEF (carbon emissions factor) of zero in their market-based Scope 2 or Scope 3 reporting (depending on how they classify emissions from their data center IT operations). Equinix enables customers to make renewable energy and carbon reduction claims by providing customers Green Power Reports which contain information about the amount and type of energy at each of their deployments within our sites.

Equinix had 12,097 employees as of December 31, 2022. The global headcount and employee home zip codes were used to calculate average commute distances for employees who were based in a Equinix facility location. In FY2022, Equinix employees continued to work from home, which would incur home working emissions that shall be quantified and included under Scope 3 Employee Commuting if the home working emissions are deemed relevant. As basis of this calculation, Equinix employees are classified as “office workers” versus “remote workers” during FY2022. For office workers, their home addresses were cross referenced against their assigned office or data center location and an estimate of commute length was determined based on zip code. Generalized automobile emissions were assumed to create the total employee commuting estimate. For remote workers, emissions were estimated using the number of remote workers by country or geographic region and the regional energy intensities (i.e., energy consumed per person per day) to estimate energy usage. The energy consumption was then converted to emissions by applying the appropriate emission factors

Change in renewable energy consumption
Please explain
In 2022, we opened or acquired thirteen new IBX data centers, opened three new xScale data centers via our joint ventures, and entered three new markets resulting in an increase in our total number of data center facilities to 248.

Despite the significant expansion in 2022, we were able to purchase more renewable energy to cover our operations (6,770 GWh in 2021 to 7,430 GWh in 2022) and this resulted in a 12% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions. The relative decrease in emissions (12%) to the increase in total revenue (9%) resulted in a 27% decrease in revenue-based intensity.

Change in renewable energy consumption	
170927
Decreased
56
Our 100% renewable energy goal is a priority for us. In 2022, 96% of our worldwide electricity consumption was covered by renewable energy contracts for wind, solar and other products. In 2022, we purchased additional renewable energy which contributed to emission reductions of 170,927 mtCO2e (calculation = 2022 RE emission reductions of 2,285,358 mtCO2e minus 2021 RE emissions reductions of 2,114,131 mtCO2e = 170,927 mtCO2e additional reductions). Our absolute Scope 1 & 2 emissions also decreased from 305,452 mtCO2e in 2021 to 268,460 mtCO2e in 2022 (or 36,992 mtCO2e or 12% decrease) as a result of Scope 1 emission reductions and additional renewable energy purchases. Thus, the emissions value (percentage) is calculated as “additional RE reductions in 2022” / “2021 emissions” = 170,927 mtCO2e / 305,452 mtCO2e = 56% reduction.
Other emissions reduction activities	
48393
Decreased
16
Our data center design standards take advantage of local conditions to improve the efficiency of our operations. For example, the primary drivers for the decrease in Scope 1 emissions include an overall reduction in refrigerant leakages due to focused efforts across our operations and the shutting down of the on-site natural gas based cogeneration facility at MX1. We also invested heavily in energy efficiency projects with $45 million USD of projects implemented in 2022. In 2022, through our operational improvements and energy efficiency projects, wee realized energy savings and emissions reductions of 48,393 mtCO2e.

Our absolute Scope 1 & 2 emissions also decreased from 305,452 mtCO2e in 2021 to 268,460 mtCO2e in 2022 (or 36,992 mtCO2e or 12% decrease) as a result of the implemented efficiency activities. Thus, the emissions value (percentage) is calculated as “project savings in 2022” / “2021 emissions” = 48,393 mtCO2e / 305,452 mtCO2e = 16% reduction.

In 2022, we opened or acquired 13 new IBX data centers, opened three new xScale data centers via our joint ventures, and entered three new markets resulting in an increase in our total number of IBX and xScale data center facilities. Despite our significant growth in 2022, our absolute emissions still decreased from 305,452 mtCO2e in 2021 to 268,460 mtCO2e in 2022 (or 36,992 mtCO2e or 12% decrease) due to the expansion of our renewable energy and efficiency programs.

The decrease in emissions from renewable energy and efficiency projects (219,320 mtCO2e) is bigger than the net decrease in the overall absolute emissions (36,992 mtCO2e). This difference is attributed to a change in output. Calculation is: Net change + other reductions = Absolute change = -36,992 mtCO2e net change + 170,927 mtCO2e (change in renewable energy) + 48,393 mtCO2e (other emissions reduction activities) = 182,328 mtCO2e. This number is then taken over the 2021 emissions to derive the % change: 182,328 mtCO2e / 305,452 mtCO2e = 60% increase.

In other words, 12% absolute increase from change in output - 56% decrease from renewable energy - 16% decrease from emission reduction activities = 12% total decrease in emissions from 2021 to 2022.

C8.2k
(C8.2k) Describe how your organization’s renewable electricity sourcing strategy directly or indirectly contributes to bringing new capacity into the grid in the countries/areas in which you operate.
Equinix is committed to procuring renewable energy worldwide, operating under a comprehensive strategy that aligns with our goal of achieving 100% clean and renewable energy. Our renewable power is sourced from diverse projects and certified products that adhere to stringent reporting and retirement standards. Our purchasing decisions revolve around four key principles:

 

(i) Utilizing renewable and low carbon energy

(ii) Procuring local sources of renewable energy whenever possible

(iii) Seeking new or recently built generation sources

(iv) Advocating for favorable renewable energy policies while considering renewable energy availability when establishing new data centers.

 

To support our strategy, we incorporate Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) into our renewable purchasing strategy. These certificates, including RECs, I-RECs, GoOs, etc., some of which are purchased with our energy supply agreements (bundled) and others purchased directly from 3rd party vendors (unbundled) are utilized. In some locations, we initially utilize EACs as a stepping stone and actively work to replace them with higher quality solutions that drive additional benefits, such as virtual Power Purchase Agreements (vPPAs). As of calendar year 2023, we have operational vPPAs totaling 225 MW and have signed vPPAs for an additional 490 MWs In other locations where unbundled EACs are the only available option, although they do not provide the same incremental benefits as vPPAs with new projects, we believe purchasing unbundled certificates still plays a vital role in sending demand signals to the market.

 

Equinix maintains its longstanding commitment to fostering collaboration and education within the renewable energy sector by our membership in CEBA (Clean Energy Buyers Association). In 2022, we elevated our engagement by becoming a Leadership Circle member in CEBA, while also contributing to the organization's board. We actively engage with companies to raise awareness about corporate renewable energy procurement and advocate for increased integration of renewables into the grid for all electricity consumers. In 2022, we served as faculty for two sessions targeting CEBA member companies. Over the years, we have participated in 12 such events since 2016, helping more than 190 Equinix customers and other CEBA members enhance their understanding of negotiating renewable energy deals. We believe that these efforts contribute to the expanding knowledge base required for successful renewable energy transactions.

Singapore
Limited supply of renewable electricity in the market
Singapore faces certain unique challenges when it comes to sourcing renewable electricity. The limited availability of suitable land for renewable energy infrastructure, such as solar farms or wind turbines, makes it challenging to generate renewable electricity at scale. As a result, Singapore heavily relies on importing electricity from neighboring countries. Furthermore, Equinix’s total load in Singapore is large enough to exhaust much of the available supply of EACs in-country. This necessitates finding EACs in near-by countries to purchase renewables. Our viewpoint is doing something is better than nothing in an extremely constrained market such as Singapore.
Australia
Prohibitively priced renewable electricity
Australia possesses vast renewable energy potential, particularly in solar and wind resources. However, the challenges of sourcing Australia LGCs arise from the exceedingly high cost to procure. The Australian government provides a back-stop to pricing and they can simply out purchase many corporate entities. Equinix relies on grid-mix in Australia due to the prohibitively high pricing.
Japan
Limited supply of renewable electricity in the market
Japan faces some similar challenges to Singapore. Limited land availability poses a constraint on large-scale renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms. The rugged terrain and densely populated areas further restrict the potential for renewable energy infrastructure development. Equinix procures a mix of high cost Japanese NFCs along with EACs sourced from China.
Republic of Korea
Limited supply of renewable electricity in the market
South Korea has been making efforts to increase its renewable energy capacity, but there are still challenges associated with sourcing renewable electricity. Availability of local EACs in South Korea is constrained and thus necessitates a procurement strategy from Chinese EACs.

Comment
Equinix purchased 4,119 allowances in 2022 and applied that together with the 105 left over from 2021 to cover the emissions from diesel generators and natural gas heaters in Europe (UK, Ireland and France). 3,745 metric tons CO2e was verified from these purchased and leftover allowances. This represents 9% of our total Scope 1 emissions in 2022. In the reporting year, a new site has been added in the list of regulated sites which purchased 2,411 allowances and verified 2,409 allowances, thereby increasing the number of both purchased and verified allowances significantly from FY 2021. As on 2022, 8 Equinix sites are regulated under the EU ETS system.
C11.1d
(C11.1d) What is your strategy for complying with the systems you are regulated by or anticipate being regulated by?
Equinix has regional environmental compliance teams in place to ensure our short and long-term compliance with all applicable carbon pricing systems or similar compliance mechanisms such as pending regulations like the U.S. SEC Climate-Related Disclosures proposal. Equinix also engages with governments to proactively participate in the development regulations for the industry. Over the course of 2020 and culminating in January 2021, Equinix, as a board member of Europeans Data Center Association (EUDCA), spearheaded the development of the Climate Neutral Data Centre Operator Pact and Self-Regulatory Initiative (“The Pact”). Equinix and the EUDCA proposed a model whereby data center operators would abide by a self-regulatory framework in support of the European Commission’s long term climate objectives. The Pact establishes a Self-Regulatory Initiative for the data center members, which commits Equinix, and other data center operator signatories, to set measurable and ambitious climate an environmental targets. In 2022, The Pact, with Equinix’s support, established four working groups to develop and propose metrics and targets for data center energy efficiency, water conservation, circular economy and processes for signatories to certify adherence to the Pact commitments.



In Europe, since 2014, Equinix has participated in the EU-ETS. As of 2022, 8 of our data centers in three European countries (UK, Ireland and France) qualify and are registered EU-ETS participants as they have an installed a qualifying generator thermal capacity of greater than 20MW. In 2022, we purchased 700 allowances and applied together with the 105 leftover allowances from 2021 to cover our emissions from generators for the UK sites (LD7, LD8 and LD11x). The total verified Scope 1 emissions is 669 metric tons CO2e. We purchased 2,811 allowances to cover our emissions from generators for the Ireland site DB3 and DB5x for a verified Scope 1 emissions of 2,468 metric tons CO2e. We purchased 608 allowances to cover our emissions from generators for the France sites (PA2, PA3, PA4 Aubervilliers, PA6, PA8x, PA9x and PA10), for a total verified Scope 1 emissions of 608 metric tons CO2e. In total, we purchased 4,119  allowances and applied together with 105 leftover from 2021. The verified Scope 1 emissions totaled 3,745 metric tons CO2e in 2022 which is 9% of Equinix’s total Scope 1 emissions. 



Case study of how we applied our strategy: Equinix does not have a free allocation and is fully exposed to market driven allowance price. We are working with a consultant to conduct qualification assessments and apply to add sites to the scheme and put permits in place to meet our EU obligations arising from this scheme. With our consultant, we have developed monitoring plan, where on a monthly basis we track our performance and at a minimum on an annual basis evaluate our performance. In the regular meetings with the consultant, we ensure we are aware of any changes to relevant legislation and legislative requirements of the scheme. Part of our management strategy is to have regular energy audits, data collection and verification. Our focus on environmental and energy regulations enable us to benefit from the varying schemes by optimizing and limiting our exposure through utilization of the appropriate instrument.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
In 2021 we launched our SBT supplier engagement strategy designed to identify, collaborate with and close climate related gaps with our most strategic suppliers through supplier education, data collection and corrective actions. To lead this effort, we hired a Director of ESG and Supplier Diversity. In this program, we invite targeted supplier groups representing 80% of supplier-related Scope 3 emissions to register and report about climate policy and annual GHG performance data via CDP supply chain program. As a part of our education path, Procurement and Supplier leaders learn about our SBT goals and the importance of their role. Our Climate Maturity Model provides a simplified 5 step supplier facing rating on progress toward SBT’s and produces a coaching plan that Procurement Leaders and Supplier Account Managers can use to self-service training materials on Climate Change, Levels of Ambition, SBT’s, Target Setting to close gaps. The Director of Supply Chain ESG works directly with suppliers to cover program details and provides feedback to suppliers in the fall Quarterly Business Review cycle. Specific suppliers who fail to make adequate progress toward the goal are referred to Executive Management at Equinix for addition Corrective Action Planning.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
The information we collect via CDP helps us to understand critical supplier climate strategy, policy and program development. It sets the tone for additional discussions within Equinix and with the supplier on how to achieve our Scope 3 supplier engagement target. Equinix a near term science-based target (SBT) to engage suppliers representing 66% of our qualified Scope 3 emissions (Purchased Goods and Services and Capital Goods) to set their SBTs by 2025.
Measures of success:
1. 100% of identified ‘new starter’ suppliers receive invitations to CDP Supply Chain annually
2. 100% of Procurement Category Manager attend annual Supplier Engagement Training
3. 50% of identified suppliers register and disclose in the ORS (this is our year 1 goal)
4. 100% of identified suppliers receive feedback on climate performance annually
5. 100% of suppliers who fail to reach Climate Maturity Model level 1 are referred for Step 1 Corrective Action Plans (CAP’s)
6. 100% of suppliers on CAP’s modify behaviour within 12 months or are referred for Step 2 escalations with senior leaders.

Based on an estimated average absolute emissions reduction of 50% per supplier involved in setting and achieving the goal, we anticipate the absolute emissions impact will be 412,500 mtCO2e per year (a 27% reduction in Equinix’s total scope 3 emissions).

We will set targets for supplier reported allocated emissions KPI’s in 2023.

Description of engagement with policy makers
Equinix has engaged with the European Commission and has been involved with its recast of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive. In support of the Directive's energy efficiency measures, we recommended that the Commission adopt efficiency metrics and targets similar to the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, such as PUE, WUE, REF, and ERF.
Details of exceptions (if applicable) and your organization’s proposed alternative approach to the policy, law or regulation
Equinix, with the European Data Centre Association (EUDCA), pushed for a more ambitious minimum IT power demand reporting threshold (100kW instead of the first proposal of 1MW) which would result in a more comprehensive coverage of the sector and more reporting entities. Other proposals were on reporting responsibilities and metrics, recommending metrics and targets similar to the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact.
Have you evaluated whether your organization’s engagement on this policy, law, or regulation is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement?
Yes, we have evaluated, and it is aligned
Please explain whether this policy, law or regulation is central to the achievement of your climate transition plan and, if so, how?
This policy, law or regulation is not central to the achievement of our climate transition plan. By adopting a high standard for energy efficiency, the EU Energy Efficiency Directive will help drive the industry to improve equipment efficiency and limit energy demand. By collecting sustainability information of data centers across the EU the EED will lead to a greater understanding of where there are inefficiencies and which parts of the sector can improve.

In 2021, Equinix, as a board member of EUDCA, spearheaded the development of the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact (“The Pact”). The Pact establishes a Self-Regulatory Initiative for cloud service providers and data center operators, which commits Equinix, and other data center signatories, to set measurable and ambitious targets for 2025 and 2030 in the following areas:
-Carbon neutrality by 2030
-Improve the efficiency of energy use
-Purchase 100% carbon-free energy
