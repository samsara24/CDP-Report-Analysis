C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
AT&T’s purpose is to connect people to greater possibility with simplicity, expertise and inspiration. This included tens of millions of direct-to-consumer relationships across wireless and broadband businesses in the United States and wireless in Mexico. In FY2022, AT&T Inc. was comprised of two reportable segments: (1) Communications, providing mobile, broadband and other communications services to U.S.-based consumers. We served nearly 2.5 million companies worldwide – from the smallest businesses to nearly all the Fortune 1000 – with highly secure, smart solutions. (2) Latin America, providing mobile services to consumers and businesses in Mexico. In April 2022, we completed our transaction to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery Inc. In June 2022, we completed our agreement with Microsoft to sell the programmatic advertising marketplace component of Xandr Inc.  



Climate change poses a direct risk to communities around the planet, as rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions result in higher global temperatures and contribute to more extreme heat, droughts, storm systems and rising sea levels. Addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation will not just manage climate-related risks but will also provide an opportunity to build a more sustainable global economy. AT&T is part of the worldwide effort to accelerate this transition and achieve net zero GHG emissions. In 2020, we committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2035 across our entire global operations (Scope 1 and 2). In 2021, we set interim targets that were approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We are scaling our efforts by also implementing emissions-reducing solutions for customers and communities and have a goal to deliver connectivity solutions that enable business customers to reduce a gigaton (1 billion metric tons) of GHG emissions between 2018 and 2035. To strengthen the resilience of our communities and company against the impacts of climate change, we are also assessing and managing our climate-related risks and empowering others to do the same.

Board-level committee
The Public Policy and Corporate Reputation Committee (PPCR) was combined with the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee in April 2022, to the Governance and Policy Committee (GPC) of the AT&T Board of Directors. The GPC has the highest level of direct responsibility for climate change-related activities within AT&T. The GPC consists of four independent Directors, including a chairperson, and meets four times/year. The GPC is briefed by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), SVP Corporate Responsibility and ESG regularly on climate-related issues as they relate to AT&T’s overall strategy. The GPC provides input/guidance in the development of our climate-related strategy and transition plan, as well as our programmatic and managerial approach to environmental and climate-related issues. Our CSO is present at all GPC meetings to discuss ESG and/or climate-related issues and may also meet intermittently with individual members of the GPC to discuss ESG or climate-related topics of interest to the individual committee member.

The GPC’s charter outlines the Committee’s responsibilities related to public policy and specifically cites its authority over corporate policies and practices in furtherance of our CSR activities, including environmental policies. Programmatic operations for climate change-related activities fall under CSR at AT&T, therefore the GPC is ultimately responsible for our climate change strategy.

The GPC has the highest level of direct responsibility for climate change within our organization. In 2022, the number of regularly scheduled committee meetings was increased from three (which was the practice for the PPCR) to four per year. The Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), SVP Corporate Responsibility and ESG, briefs the GPC on our climate-related strategies and goals. Our CSO may also meet intermittently with individual members of the GPC, to discuss specific sustainability topics of interest to the individual committee member. The GPC reviews the entirety of AT&T’s climate-related strategy, including all public targets (such as those governing supply chain, energy intensity, water intensity, fleet, etc.). The GPC also provides input into our strategy related to energy policy, such as investing in renewable and alternative energy purchases. As climate-related issues arise, they are reviewed in regular fashion, much the same way other topics are reviewed and discussed at the Board level.

The Human Resources Committee oversees the compensation and benefits program for our executive officers on behalf of the Board of Directors, which includes establishing the strategic measures of our short-term incentive awards. As described in C1.3a, the strategic measures include ESG-related metrics. With respect to employees below the executive officer level, the executive officers establish the particular strategic measures applicable to their respective organizations, including ESG-related metrics, to be consistent with the strategic measures established by the Human Resources Committee.

This goal will measure emissions reductions enabled by a set of Smart Climate Solutions from 2018—2035 and progress will be reported annually. Launched in April 2022, AT&T Business Enterprise sellers who sell a Smart Climate Solution will earn up to $5k for completing a customer driven emission reduction factor. Emission reduction factors are extremely important as we work towards achieving our public Gigaton goal. Between 2018 and 2022, AT&T identified 24 Smart Carbon Solutions for which we have calculated emissions reductions. Use of these solutions has enabled emissions reductions of 149.2 million metric tons of CO2e—approximately 15% of our Gigaton Goal.
Explain how this incentive contributes to the implementation of your organization’s climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
Seizing opportunities is one of three main focus areas of AT&T’s climate strategy and transition plan. Universal connectivity — nationwide broadband, including 5G — can play a meaningful role in reducing emissions by scaling efficiencies and enabling low-carbon technologies. This presents a business opportunity that also benefits society. We have set a goal to deliver connectivity solutions that enable our business customers to reduce 1 gigaton (one billion metric tons) of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035.

C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
AT&T’s corporate risks are continuously evaluated for impact based on factors such as reputation, financial, operation, and probability of occurrence. The level of risk related impact for each factor ranges from 1 (insignificant) to 5 (catastrophic). Any climate-related risk that has the potential to impact our network reliability or performance, or our ability to service customers, is considered a substantive financial and strategic risk. A quantifiable indicator of a substantive impact would be a measurable disruption to our network’s reliability that would in turn cause disruption to the customer since they depend on consistent coverage.  For CDP reporting, one metric we may consider substantive is the quantitative impact relative to 1% or more of Adjusted EBITDA.

Description of process
Description of process:
In 2022, AT&T hired a third-party consultant to help facilitate and conduct a climate risk assessment and scenario analysis. This process engaged internal stakeholders across multiple business units to provide insight on past, present, and future climate-related risks and opportunities to the company. The working team included representatives from sustainability, enterprise risk management, network resiliency, finance, public policy, energy, legal, and strategy. Their collective insights and analysis of the company’s operations, strategy, and products/services served a key input to create a longlist of climate-related risks and opportunities likely to be relevant to AT&T’s business. Next, the third party employed quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to assess each risk or opportunity within a Climate Vulnerability framework, including metrics to rate each on their exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Climate data provided by the IPCC was used to model the likely exposure of AT&T’s facilities and operations to physical risks, including precipitation, extreme heat, mean temperature rise, wind speeds, and drought. For transition risks and opportunities, exposure scores were developed by utilizing company data on emissions, energy usage, and market analysis, among others. The sensitivity and adaptive capacity scores were qualitatively determined through a survey of internal stakeholders across the business. The survey results were used to prioritize the top risks and opportunities likely to present the largest financial, strategic, and environmental impact to the company. These risks and opportunities were further analyzed along three time horizons identified by AT&T: short (present-2025); medium (2025-2030); long (2030-2050). The prioritized risks and opportunities were further analyzed in an interactive, tabletop workshop with the stakeholders to explore risk mitigation and resilience efforts. Some of the prioritized risks and opportunities were further quantified for their potential financial impact on the company. To calculate the financial impact of physical climate risks, AT&T used IPCC climate data along two climate scenarios out to 2100. AT&T included over 250k assets across our mobility, wireline, and retail portfolio as part of this analysis. These sites were selected to ensure global geospatial diversity. In the future, AT&T will look to use higher resolution climate data and enhanced internal data collection methods on disaster costs, to improve accuracy of financial risk quantification. Transitional risks and opportunities were calculated based on historical energy consumption patterns, future climate scenario projections (e.g., IEA), forecasts on U.S. state renewable energy portfolio requirements, and globally accredited research articles from professional organizations, thinktanks, NGOs, and academia.
Management Response / Actions:
We proactively monitor potential nature-related threats to our network, employees and communities through our AT&T Weather Operations Center. Our network team builds all cell sites to meet or exceed local structural standards—including those in disaster prone areas. We conduct rolling assessments throughout the year to evaluate the vulnerability of cell sites and priority central office locations to wind, ice storms & other environmental factors. We also deploy high-capacity battery backup to these sites, helping maintain service in the event of a power loss. To prepare for natural disasters, we regularly test on-site batteries & take steps to ensure fixed generators are fueled on a regular basis. We have invested more than $650 million in our Network Disaster Recovery (NDR) Program, which exists to rapidly restore communications to areas affected by disasters. Investments include capital expenditures such as building mobile satellite cells on light trucks, as well as operational expenditures such as field training exercises. We are committed to on-the-ground testing and have dedicated 160,000 working hours to full-scale NDR recovery exercises in the field, which test the preparedness of our equipment and abilities. To help us plan, build and maintain our network in the face of extreme weather and long-term climate change, in 2019 we developed our Climate Change Analysis Tool (CCAT). By analyzing the modeled climate data under the RCP 8.5 warming scenario and physical risk implications of the future climate, our industry-leading CCAT helps network engineers understand how inland and coastal flooding, drought, wind or wildfires may impact existing infrastructure or future network builds – up to 30 years into the future. In 2022, we continued to make the projections more actionable, and AT&T’s resilience team created a simplified risk score (1-10 scale) for key climate hazards. AT&T’s mobility planning tool integrates these risk scores so that when a designer considers location options for a new piece of mobility equipment, physical climate risks can be factored into the decision. This allows AT&T the opportunity to proactively build sites with lower risk and cost, reduce downtime due to disasters and harden our network for the future. The implementation of climate data into decision-making frameworks and workflows ultimately helps to create climate-resilient infrastructure and a climate-informed workforce. We’ve made our climate data available to the public, and in 2022, AT&T, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory debuted the Climate Risk and Resilience Portal (ClimRR). The portal provides AT&T and Argonne’s high-resolution data about localized future climate risks in an accessible format to state, local, tribal and territorial emergency managers and other community leaders.
Internal assessments:
AT&T explores both mitigation and adaptation strategies when considering climate change risks. To help identify and assess climate-related risk to our operations, we use the AT&T CCAT on an ongoing basis. We’re incorporating climate data in our model to drive prioritization of work and investment to improve network resiliency. As an example, we have assets called Mobile Telephone Switching Offices (MTSOs), which contain many critical network elements. These are high-priority sites and are spread across the country. By integrating coastal storm surge and flood data from Argonne into our vulnerability modeling for these sites, we can make better decisions about which sites should be priority-one hardening investments. In hurricane-prone areas, like Southeastern U.S., we’re planning to make investments in new generators, rectifiers and batteries, maintain critical electrical equipment like HVACs, install flood gates and upgrade switchgear equipment. Also, once a location has been approved for enhancements, the construction and engineering teams can make more informed decisions about how to protect the site.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
AT&T is a global company. As such, we are subject to regulation at multiple layers including local, state, national, and international jurisdictions. As part of their regular duties, our internal public policy, legislative affairs and compliance teams monitor the regulations and legislation (including climate-related regulations) we are subject to – and our responses – to help ensure we adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. These teams report any changes or policies that may impact our company to the appropriate channels, including the Chief Sustainability Officer and applicable other officers. We are also subject to voluntary guidelines, such as energy efficiency requirements for our products, through engagement with groups such as the Voluntary Agreements on Energy Efficiency for Small Network Equipment. We work to comply with such voluntary guidelines, as well.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
Some jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted cap-and-trade mechanisms to reduce carbon emissions. For example, California adopted such a system in 2017. The State of Washington has also taken significant steps toward adopting a cap-and-trade, contingent on transportation infrastructure funding. AT&T has substantial operations in both these states.
To understand the impact to AT&T of this and other emerging or pending regulations and laws, our local and relevant jurisdictional public policy teams monitor public news channels and legislative media and conduct research into how proposed bills could impact our company. As the legislative landscape changes rapidly and at multiple levels, we include such risks in our regular risk assessments. Should risks rise to a level of significance such that we reasonably believe they would inhibit our ability to serve our customers, provide a reliable network or drive value for our shareholders, we would actively pursue solutions to mitigate the risks.
In addition, carbon tax plans, such as those proposed by the Climate Leadership Council (CLC) and the Transportation and Climate Initiative (covering several eastern states and similar to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative), would apply to AT&T should those programs become law. AT&T supports and is a founding member of the CLC. As such proposals continue to develop and move into legislative processes, we will monitor their potential effect on our business.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
AT&T has chosen to invest in renewable energy, where appropriate. We continue to be one of the largest corporate purchasers of renewable energy in the United States.

An example of a technology risk tied to our renewable strategy is the capacity of battery storage. When reviewing renewable energy investment opportunities, we closely evaluated available storage technologies to help ensure that the energy generated could be viably and reliably stored for future use. If innovations in battery storage technology do not keep pace with our demands, and we are not able to reliably and cost-effectively store renewable energy, we may need to continue to use fossil fuel-based energy. As we continue to evaluate future energy deals, consideration of technological developments such as battery storage capabilities may shape our decision-making.

To hedge our technology risk, AT&T is working with RMI’s Third Derivative, a group that works with emerging technologies, providing direct feedback on business viability and improving odds of success from both the financial and business case perspectives.
Legal	
Not relevant, included
Potential legal risks related to new and developing climate-related regulations are included in our risk assessments and deemed not relevant at this time. To date, we have not been the subject of climate-related litigation.
Market	
Relevant, always included
Customer demand is a market risk included as part of our standard considerations when developing new product and service offerings. There is currently a market demand for technologies that enable carbon savings and help reduce business customers’ carbon footprints and climate impacts. We believe AT&T solutions can address this demand. As such, we invest in customer solutions that enable carbon reductions through our Smart Climate Solutions initiative.
Should customer and market demand decrease and shift away from low-carbon or climate impact mitigating solutions, such action could negatively affect demand for our products and services. We would consider such facts as we plan for the development and roll-out of such offerings in the future.
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
Customers increasingly expect companies to be good corporate stewards and act responsibly. AT&T strives to be a leader in climate action, and we believe that such leadership is beneficial for our reputation. On a monthly basis, AT&T surveys stakeholders to assess their perception of our corporate reputation and brand, including the emotional attachment of consumers who state they are familiar with our company’s operations. We measure interest in and awareness of specific AT&T corporate responsibility programs and emerging social issues, and sample impressions of programs in development. Our measurements confirm that awareness of AT&T corporate responsibility efforts (such as climate-related initiatives) improves company reputation – which in turn positively affects key business metrics such as willingness to buy or recommend, and willingness to give AT&T the benefit of the doubt in difficult times. If we did not act to build and communicate our corporate responsibility story—particularly as it relates to climate-related issues such as the management of GHG emissions and support for renewable energy—AT&T could be at a reputational disadvantage to other companies in the technology sector. We communicate our climate-related actions through various channels, including an annual sustainability report and website. We set public climate-related goals and communicate our progress toward those targets. For example, we set a goal to be carbon neutral (net zero scopes 1 & 2) by 2035. In addition, our AT&T Gigaton Goal to deliver connectivity solutions that enable business customers to reduce a gigaton (1 billion metric tons) of GHG emissions by 2035 shows our commitment to deliver services that help AT&T business customers avoid carbon emissions. We report progress against our Gigaton Goal annually. Between 2018 and 2022, AT&T identified 24 Smart Carbon Solutions for which we have calculated emissions reductions. Use of these solutions has enabled emissions reductions of 149.2 million metric tons of CO2e—approximately 15% of our Gigaton Goal.
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included
Acute physical risks such as extreme weather events can cause damage to physical assets and potentially disrupt our network infrastructure and performance. Climate-related risks that have the potential to impact our network reliability are included in our risk assessments. Our Climate Change Analysis Tool helps us visualize potential physical risk and understand potential asset vulnerabilities at a neighborhood-level up to 30-years into the future, using data from Argonne National Lab.
We conduct regular analysis to evaluate the vulnerability of cell sites and priority central office locations to wind, ice storms & other environmental factors. We deploy high-capacity battery backup to our cell sites, helping them remain in service in the event of a commercial power loss. To prepare our network for natural disasters, we regularly test these batteries and take steps to help ensure fixed generators are fueled on a regular basis. We also proactively monitor potential nature-related threats to our network, employees and communities through our Weather Operations Center. We have invested more than $650 million in our Network Disaster Recovery (NDR) Program, which exists to rapidly restore communications to areas affected by disasters. We are committed to on-the-ground testing and have dedicated 160,000 working hours to full-scale NDR recovery exercises in the field, which test the preparedness of our equipment and abilities. These drills help local and regional first responders understand the role and abilities of our NDR organization, and they maintain the readiness of our teams and equipment to respond at a moment’s notice to recover a failed network office or network element in disaster situations.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, always included
Chronic physical risks, such as changes in mean temperatures, could increase our operating costs as AT&T requires water to cool many of our buildings / facilities. An increase in average temperatures could impact operating costs by requiring more water to operate water-cooled air conditioning units or to irrigate landscaping. Our Core Network Operations team monitors and tracks historic water usage and rates and our Weather Operations Center tracks forecasts. Cross-checking such data enables us to understand the relationship between daily temperatures and our water costs. Drought projections for the contiguous 48 states are also included in our Climate Change Analysis Tool, allowing us to identify regions at higher drought risk. In 2022, AT&T used 2.676 billion gallons of water. To mitigate the risk of increased operating costs associated with the purchase of water (to cool certain facilities or to provide irrigation) due to rising mean temperatures, AT&T has active water management efforts in place. We work to reduce water consumption in our facilities by cleaning cooling towers, enhancing proactive maintenance and repairs, utilizing smart irrigation systems, and providing connectivity for monitoring systems to enable remote, near real-time water use tracking and management.

Company-specific description
Extreme weather events precipitated by long-term climate change have the potential to directly damage network facilities or disrupt our ability to build and maintain portions of our network and could potentially disrupt suppliers’ ability to provide products and services required to provide reliable network coverage. Extreme weather events such as the highly active tropical storm season along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and, and the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires across the Western U.S., have the potential to directly damage our network facilities or disrupt our ability to maintain portions of our network. In 2021, Hurricane Ida caused substantial impacts to our network in Louisiana from power outages and storm damage. As of Q1 2023, our network includes more than 1.4 million route miles of fiber globally and carries over 600 petabytes of data traffic on an average business day. Any such disruption could delay network deployment plans, interrupt service for our customers, increase our costs and have a negative effect on our operating results. The potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires and other climate related events, could adversely affect our operations, infrastructure and financial results. Operational impacts resulting from the potential physical effects of climate change, such as damage to our network infrastructure (e.g., cell towers, central offices or other physical assets), could result in increased costs and loss of revenue. We could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure - including proactively relocating equipment or implementing network hardening solutions - and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climate change.

Explanation of financial impact figure
We calculated the expected increase in financial impacts related to climate-related weather events. This financial impact quantification incorporates historic AT&T weather-related costs from severe storms and wildfires with the probable change in frequency of extreme precipitation and wildfire events, using IPCC climate data and geospatial analysis for AT&T's U.S. wireline, mobility and retail assets. Overall Assumptions: Base repair/capital costs stay consistent and frequency of events change, thus increasing costs. Costs are not adjusted for inflation.
• AT&T extreme precipitation costs include capital costs from hurricanes, severe storms and severe weather, and repair costs estimated to be 10x a factor of the capital costs. Change in Max 5-Day Precipitation compare 2040 levels to 1981-2010 historical climatology (applied as 2010 levels) for U.S. only.
• AT&T wildfire costs include capital costs from wildfire only and repair costs estimated to be 10x a factor of the capital costs. Change in cumulative dry days (CDD) and extreme heat days compare 2040 levels to 1981-2010 historical climatology (applied as 2010 levels) for California only. Cooling degree days (CDD) is weighted 75% and extreme heat days 25% as a proxy for increased wildfire probability. These proxies are due to a lack of high-resolution, future-facing wildfire data.
• AT&T total financial impact ($7,500,000-$70,700,000) = extreme precipitation costs ($6,100,000-$56,300,000) + wildfire costs ($1,400,000-$7,900,000)

Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
Our network team builds all cell sites to meet or exceed state structural standards— including those in disaster prone areas. We conduct regular analysis to help ensure cell sites can withstand wind, ice & other environmental factors. We also deploy high-capacity battery backup to these sites, allowing them to remain in service in the event of a power loss. To prepare for natural disasters, we regularly test these batteries & take steps to ensure fixed generators are fueled on a regular basis. We proactively monitor potential nature-related threats to our network, employees and communities through our Weather Operations Center. Through our Network Disaster Recovery (NDR) organization we have run nearly 80 full-scale in-field recovery exercises, which are vital to testing our equipment & abilities. We have invested >$650 million in our NDR programs since 1992. 90% of the investment is spent on domestic NDR programs, and the remaining 10% is spent on international NDR initiatives. The investments include capital expenditures (such as building new mobile satellite cell sites on light trucks) as well as other expenditures such as field training exercises. To better understand the physical risks that climate change poses to our network, we’ve been working with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory. Argonne performs the data engineering and climate modelling that projects the impact and likelihood of various hazards occurring. This dataset is sophisticated, as it provides insights at the neighborhood level and looks out to 30 years into the future. Leveraging these data layers, our data scientists built our Climate Change Analysis Tool (CCAT) which helps us anticipate and visualize potential impacts of climate hazards, like flooding and intense winds, on our network infrastructure & operations. This information can be used to mitigate physical risk, for example, it can inform for asset maintenance efforts, network hardening projects, disaster recovery resourcing and future network investments. In 2020, we expanded the capabilities and the geographical coverage of our CCAT tool to incorporate drought, wildfire and temperature rise for the contiguous 48 states, which we’re integrating into our internal planning systems. Our internal climate resilience team continues to use CCAT to analyze the potential impact of the hazards on our infrastructure and then relay these insights to key business unit partners like network resiliency.

Company-specific description
In 2015, AT&T set a goal to enable customer carbon savings 10 times the footprint of our operations by 2025. We recognized that many of our products and services can help our customers be more efficient and reduce emissions, creating an opportunity to drive revenues through access to new and emerging markets with these types of products and services. Following AT&T’s commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035, we sought a more ambitious goal for enablement of customer GHG emissions reductions. In 2021, we retired our 10x goal and announced the AT&T Gigaton Goal to deliver connectivity solutions that enable business customers to reduce a gigaton (1 billion metric tons) of GHG emissions by 2035.

AT&T-enabled technology solutions such as Internet of Things, 5G, edge computing and fiber have the potential to reveal inefficiencies and reduce wasted electricity, fuel, water and/or raw materials – which can lead to reduced GHG emissions across multiple markets, including areas in which AT&T has an opportunity to introduce new technologies. AT&T is uniquely positioned to deliver many of these benefits to our customers because of our scope and expertise: For example, as of Q1 2023, AT&T’s 5G network reaches 290 million Americans. We also cover more than 19.7 million consumer and more than 3 million business customer locations in 100+ metro areas in the U.S. with fiber, supporting our ability to bring connectivity technology to more areas and markets. In addition, we use many of these technology solutions in our own operations, so we bring practical experience to our customers.

We believe that collaborating with our customers on AT&T-integrated technology solutions can create new opportunities for AT&T to introduce technology into new industries and markets, such as Smart Cities; industrial; manufacturing; retail; and supply chain and transportation.

Explanation of financial impact figure
If we capture opportunities related to introducing technology into new industries and markets, it could mean an increased revenue opportunity for our Business Solutions organization. It’s impossible to predict demand, but if we assume demand for more efficient products and services drives a potential 1% increase in consolidated sales of services, we could estimate a potential annual revenue increase of about $350 million. We calculated this based on our 2022 Business Solutions revenue of approximately $35 billion. 1% of $35 billion is $350 million. If our expectations are wrong and none of our customers find value in AT&T technology solutions that also reduce their GHG emissions, then financial impact could be as low as $0. However, given the rise of corporate interest in reducing emissions, we don’t expect this minimum impact to occur.

Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
We have identified 8 key impact areas that have substantial climate impact and could benefit from operations enhanced by our technology: Modern Workplace; Transportation; Healthcare; Consumer/Retail; Smart Cities/Buildings; Energy; Industrial; Food/Beverage & Agriculture. We work to identify potential customers and develop product offerings that can help those industries drive cost and emissions from their business, such as our Internet-of-Things (IoT), 5G, edge computing and fiber solutions. To capitalize on such opportunities, we work with customers to create case studies showing how our technologies have enabled positive environmental impacts. For example: our customer GCP Applied Technologies’ Verifi® In-transit Concrete Management System uses AT&T IoT connectivity help reduce emissions from wasted trips and excess material. According to our case study from 2022, GCP Applied Technologies used AT&T IoT connectivity to produce 29.76 million cubic yards of concrete and avoided 107,294.34 metric tons of CO2e. We use case studies like this as marketing and promotional content to show the climate-related benefits of AT&T technologies and services. The case studies quantify the GHG emissions reduction potential that AT&T technology enables in a wide range of impact areas. Using these examples allows us to turn the idea of tech-enabled GHG reductions into a relatable story for other customers. We expect these concrete examples can help expand the conversations we have with our customers. Between 2018-2022, we calculate cumulative customer emissions reductions enabled by AT&T of 149.2 million metric tons of CO2e – 15% attainment toward our Gigaton Goal. AT&T has the equivalent of 2 Director and 1 Senior management employees who spend a large part of their time developing and executing the plans to meet our goal. We estimate costs for this work by using an average cost of $300,000 for Director salary and benefits and $200,000 for Senior management salary and benefits for the time spent on the Gigaton goal for a total of $800,000. We assume that other work done by AT&T employees to support this work is included in employees’ regular work scope and is not incremental.

AT&T updated its climate-related scenario analysis in 2022/2023. For transition scenarios, we used two publicly available scenarios: (1) shows the trajectory implied by today’s existing climate and energy-related policy settings and (2) assumes that all aspirational climate related targets announced by governments are met on time and in full, including their long‐term net zero and energy access goals. The latter scenario reflects efforts to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. These scenarios were aligned by matching the projected increase in mean temperatures globally. Comparing the input from internal stakeholders and historical company metrics to the above customized climate scenario, AT&T was able to prioritize the climate-relate risks and opportunities most relevant to the company.

Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
To help us better understand how AT&T is positioned to respond to climate change, we use a climate-related scenario analysis to assess the potential impacts and magnitude of climate-related risks and opportunities on our operations, including physical risk from acute and chronic climatic changes that could impact our network infrastructure; our products and services; and our brand, including extreme weather events, precipitation, drought, and changes in mean temperatures. Our 2022 climate scenario analysis identified three physical risks: heavy precipitation, wind and heat waves. To calculate the financial impact of physical climate risks, AT&T used IPCC climate data along two climate scenarios out to 2100. AT&T included over 250,000 assets across our mobility, wireline, and retail portfolio as part of this analysis. The estimated potential cost associated with our top quantifiable physical risk is $70,700,000. AT&T also assesses transition-related risks along various categories, including market, technology, policy & legal, and reputation. Examples of these include the impact of environmental regulations, developments in technology and market or reputational factors on our company. Our 2022/2023 climate scenario analysis identified two transitional risks: Network traffic and energy needs / 5G rollout conflicting with Decarbonization Goal, and Evolving requirements and expectations of regulators, investors and business customers (e.g., costs from U.S. carbon pricing on AT&T emissions).

As climate-related risks are identified or considered, they are analyzed through our company-wide internal risk management processes, in collaboration with business units such as compliance, finance, legal, public policy and others. Most importantly, the results of the scenario analysis reinforced our commitment to reach carbon neutrality for our operations by 2035 and informed our Climate Strategy & Transition Plan. AT&T will increase engagement with key internal and external stakeholders, over the next couple of years, to explore opportunities for additional mitigation measures to reduce impact from the top identified risks and scale impact of top identified opportunities. For example, in 2023, several cross-functional working groups were organized to begin work on resulting action items. AT&T will continue to monitor market prices and requirements around renewable energy market mechanisms and assess opportunities to scale these mitigation measures. AT&T will also continue to improve data collection processes and management, build awareness around key climate risks & opportunities, and regularly review potential emerging risks and opportunities, as well as key data sources and evidence used in the scenario analysis.

Products and services	
Yes
How is the strategy influenced: Information and communication technology (ICT) solutions – including hardware, software, and broadband and wireless technologies – can enable people and businesses to make more energy-efficient choices and reduce environmental impacts in many ways. AT&T has set a goal to deliver connectivity solutions that enable our business customers to reduce a gigaton (1 B MT CO2e) of GHG emissions by 2035. Between 2018-2022, cumulative tracked customer emissions reductions enabled by AT&T totaled approximately 149.2 M MT CO2e - approx. 15% progress toward our 2035 Gigaton Goal. We engage customers and technology collaborators to integrate AT&T technology to drive energy and resource efficiency. As we talk to customers, we learn that many are committed to reducing their emissions and have set public goals to do so. We are able to share how AT&T’s products and services can help them reduce their own emissions or create products to help their customers reduce their emissions.
What is the time horizon: Our Gigaton Goal runs through 2035. We actively engage customers toward achievement of this goal and expect to continue until the goal is achieved.
Substantial strategic decision: Our Gigaton Goal has support from the highest level of the business, including officer members of our CSR Governance Council, led by our Chief Sustainability Officer, and Governance and Policy Committee of the AT&T Board of Directors. We have a working team of CSR, sales and product representatives that meets regularly to seize this opportunity. We developed case studies that quantify GHG emissions reduction potential AT&T technology enables across a wide range of impact areas, including EV charging stations, smart buildings, energy efficient network equipment and pipeline leak detection. These real-world applications serve as relatable examples for other customers and can help drive demand for AT&T products and services that enable emissions reductions. We invest in our network infrastructure each year, creating the platform for our 5G, fiber, and IoT technologies that are key enablers of efficiency for our customers. We anticipate that opportunities will continue to increase over the next several decades. We are committed to engaging stakeholders on the ability of AT&T technology to enable carbon emissions reductions through 2035 and beyond (long term time horizon).
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
Extreme weather events could disrupt our suppliers’ ability to provide us with the products and services we require to provide a reliable network to our customers. Our strategy has been influenced such that we build redundancies into our supply chain and sourcing strategies so we are not overly reliant on individual suppliers. If any given supplier were to be impacted by extreme weather events and unable to fulfill its obligation to AT&T, redundancies built into our sourcing strategies would help ensure our ability to maintain operations. The time horizon covered by this strategy is long-term, as is our overall sourcing strategy. AT&T made the substantive and strategic decision to use the supply chain TIA Assessor Tool and to participate in the CDP Supply Chain Survey, both of which assess suppliers' GHG emissions and related climate risk and resiliency. With the data we receive from these tools, we can better understand how our suppliers are improving their resiliency against climate risk, including extreme weather events. Note: Starting in 2023, AT&T will no longer utilize the TIA Assessor in our supplier sustainability program.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
The identified climate-related risks and opportunities have impacted how we engage customers around the benefits of AT&T’s products and services. AT&T set a goal to deliver connectivity solutions that enable business customers to reduce a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. We call this the AT&T Gigaton Goal. Between 2018-2022, AT&T has tracked cumulative customer emissions reductions we’ve enabled of approximately 149.2 million MT CO2e.This reflects approximately 15% progress toward our 2035 Gigaton Goal.

As we make progress toward that goal, we are engaging customers and technology collaborators to integrate AT&T technology into business processes to drive energy and resource efficiency. These innovations and products require investment in research and development (R&D) to meet the demands of our customers and meet our Gigaton Goal.

The demand for lower emissions products and services could impact our investment in R&D related to these products by driving an increase in R&D to develop and bring to market those products and services.

We continue to actively engage customers in this discussion and we expect to continue to do so for years to come, even beyond the Gigaton Goal 2035 target year (long-term time horizon). As we talk to customers, we have received feedback that many are committed to reducing their emissions and have set public goals to show their commitment – presenting an opportunity for AT&T technology to enable those reductions.

As part of our efforts to meet our Gigaton Goal, we are inviting customers with climate-focused goals to collaborate with AT&T on solutions like Internet-of-Things (IoT) and 5G—solutions that can help them or their customers reduce their environmental impacts. In general, we see ongoing demand for our products and services that have the potential to help reduce emissions. As such, we have made the substantial and strategic decision to invest in 5G, fiber, and IoT technology that are key enablers of efficiency for our customers.
Operations	
Yes
The identified climate-related risks and opportunities impact our operations in many ways, including our approach to resource conservation to manage operating costs. Our strategy to address risk to our operations is to set goals to make our operations more efficient, thereby lowering our consumption of resources such as fuel and water. We set long-term goals to address these risks, commensurate with AT&T’s climate change and GHG emissions reduction strategy. Any increase in price of the resources we consume to power our operations could lead to an increase in our operating costs. This applies to water and fossil fuel-based energies.

We work to reduce our consumption where possible but do rely in part on natural resources to power our network and fleet. AT&T takes a two-pronged approach to reducing emissions. We first focus on how to reduce consumption of resources. Second, we see how consumption can be less impactful. Our efforts include decreasing water and kWh consumption while managing an ever-increasing amount of network traffic. Additionally, we focus on making the kWh consumption of our network more environmentally friendly by procuring large quantities of renewable energy. As we transition to EVs, the corresponding energy consumption will be targeted towards renewables to minimize the impact.

Approx. 19% of our water consumption occurs in areas designated as high or extremely high water stressed environments. AT&T strives to reduce domestic water consumption in high and extremely high water stressed areas.
Scope 2 emissions account for the majority of our total operational emissions. Since purchased kWh represents our greatest opportunity for emissions savings, we have multi-year transition plans in place to reduce kWh consumption where possible and accelerate energy efficiency efforts. Our most strategic decision in this area is to engage in long-term strategic renewable energy contracts, which will help reduce dependence on fossil fuel-based electricity. We are also committed to be carbon neutral across our global operations by 2035. To guide our progress toward our net-zero emissions goal, we set a 2030 Science Based Target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions that aligns to 1.5-degree scenario and was approved by the SBTi. The time horizon for this strategy is long-term, as are our goals and renewable energy contracts.

Assets
Our Climate Change Analysis Tool (CCAT) allows AT&T to identify long term climate-related risks and apply this insight to short term decision-making. Our climate adaptation strategy includes both our current assets as well as the siting of future assets such as network equipment. Making current and future assets more climate resilient has significant potential cost savings opportunities, as it helps to ensure we maintain service in the face of future climate change impacts.
Case study and Time horizon:
Situation: To help mitigate the financial impact of extreme weather disruptions on the company, AT&T wanted to understand the potential impact of climate change on its physical infrastructure.
Task: Secure credible and actionable climate data in order to build a tool to visualize climate impacts on AT&T infrastructure.
Action: AT&T’s CSR team and Argonne National Labs developed a plan for Argonne to produce climate data that AT&T could leverage to build a tool, capable of visualizing climate impacts on the company’s infrastructure. Once a concept had been developed, the CSR team met with key stakeholders in the business including network, finance, and risk management teams to discuss what features and inputs the tool would need to help with network maintenance and planning. This feedback was factored into the development of the tool.
Results: In 2019, AT&T launched the first iteration of the CCAT tool, initially covering the southeast region, and in September 2020, AT&T announced its expansion to cover the 48 contiguous U.S. states. We are now able to use CCAT to cross-reference fiber cable locations with inland and coastal flooding projections that look out 30 years in the future (spanning short-, medium- and long-term time frames). We can also now visualize the impact of climate-related events such as wind, droughts and wildfires on network assets like cell sites and central offices. Damage to these assets can cost millions of dollars and inhibit our ability to provide network services to our customers, which can negatively impact our reputation. We use information from our CCAT tool in our strategic planning processes related to investments in preventative maintenance, disaster recovery and future construction decisions. For example, the climate data is integrated into our site selection, network hardening and construction processes, including deciding whether additional investments are necessary add physical barriers like flood gates help protect assets from flooding risk.
Looking ahead, the climate resilience working team is building and testing new methodologies to simplify and apply the data as well as interviewing business stakeholders to identify additional use cases. For example, In 2022, we received, validated and analyzed new climate data from Argonne covering inland and coastal flooding for the Northeast and Gulf regions of the U.S. We also developed a new methodology to simplify hazard data, making it easier for network engineers to use the data to deliver business value. At the same time, we are integrating the climate data into our network planning and design tools. Our mobility team can use the climate projections to identify locations that are at higher risk of climate impacts. This helps the team plan future network builds and allows AT&T unique insight into how various climate events affect different parts of our infrastructure. Our risk management organization has showcased the CCAT tool and climate data insights to insurance vendors, positioning AT&T to potentially benefit from insurance cost savings and/or improved terms of insurance coverage.
Also, communities face an unprecedented challenge to simultaneously respond to and prepare for the shocks that climate change is wreaking on infrastructure, critical systems and people. As the frequency and severity of climate-related events increase, it’s critical for community leaders and public safety officials to have the tools and actionable insights needed to assess and address their vulnerabilities.

To solve this problem, we’ve made our climate data available to the public. To scale the awareness and utilization of the data, AT&T, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory have created the Climate Risk and Resilience Portal (ClimRR). The portal provides AT&T and Argonne’s high-resolution data about localized future climate risks in an accessible format to state, local, tribal and territorial emergency managers and other community leaders.

AT&T has committed to be carbon neutral across its entire global operations by 2035. The company aims to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
Do you intend to neutralize any unabated emissions with permanent carbon removals at the target year?
Yes
Planned milestones and/or near-term investments for neutralization at target year
Though AT&T aims to reduce our footprint to as close to zero emissions as possible, there may be some sources of emissions that cannot be eliminated. AT&T may evaluate neutralizing unabated emissions intermittently, through the purchase of high-quality carbon offsets, if we deviate from the planned trajectory toward our emissions reductions plan.

(C4.3c) What methods do you use to drive investment in emissions reduction activities?
Method	Comment
Dedicated budget for energy efficiency
Within the Energy Team, we have dedicated resources focused on identifying and testing energy and emissions-saving products. These are evaluated as Proof-of-concept to examine the materiality of the promised benefit, the scalability of the solution, and favorability of the overall business case to AT&T.
Internal incentives/recognition programs
To promote accountability and drive results, we use an Energy Scorecard to benchmark the energy performance at our top 800 energy-consuming facilities and 1,200 retail locations. The Scorecard reports energy management at each of these facilities. In addition, Scorecards report on projects and initiatives undertaken by the Real Estate Organization and with the Network Decommissioning Program. The Energy Scorecards are published quarterly to all Real Estate Organization Directors and network to enable them to see clearly how their energy use is trending. Quarterly, the Energy Team — led by the AVP of Network Engineering & Operations — reviews performances and gives each Energy ’scorecarded’ facility a grade, determined by not only by savings results, but also by the types of initiatives attempted for the facility personnel. The Retail Scorecards are scheduled to be reviewed on an annual basis.
Other (Energy Industry Leadership and Collaboration)
We collaborate with others in the industry and across our supply chain to develop more efficient products and practices. AT&T is a founding member in The Green Grid, a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers and business computing ecosystems – and GreenTouch, an industry consortium whose mission is to deliver the architecture, specifications and roadmap to increase network energy efficiency by a factor of 1,000 compared to 2010 levels. AT&T is a member, and one of our officers is Chairman of the Board of Directors, of the Alliance for Telecommunication Industry Solutions (ATIS), the North American telecommunications standards development organization. AT&T also initiated and vice-chair the ATIS STEP-TEE (Sustainability in Telecom: Energy and Protection - Telecommunications Energy Efficiency) committee, which developed a methodology for measuring and reporting the energy efficiency of telecommunications equipment. AT&T is involved with the US Green Building Council (USGBC) and its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program, a third-party verification program for green building. Several AT&T facilities have received prestigious LEED Platinum or Gold certifications. Finally, AT&T participates in organizations such as Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and its Customer Advisory Group (CAG), as well as the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE).
Other (Network transformation)
In our Network organizations, programs and structures are in place to carefully engineer the transformation from our legacy network architecture toward AT&T's Software Defined Network (SDN) through Network Functions Virtualization, and to evaluate our capacity needs across every platform and layer. Through this, we craft and execute on detailed plans to eliminate capacity and componentry that is not required for the longer vision of the AT&T SDN. For FY2022, we had 1,590M annualized kWh removed from the network via decommission activity. In FY2023, with Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) sunset largely completed, we are currently forecasting 387M annualized kWh to be removed from the network via decommission activities. The removed components represent incremental reduction in our electrical and environmental (cooling) load, as well as our space requirements.
Other (Low carbon purchase strategy)
AT&T continues to be one of the largest corporate purchasers of renewable energy in the U.S. AT&T is currently ranked 6th on the EPA’s Green Power Partnership Fortune 500 Partners List. In 2022, AT&T supported the production of nearly 2.8 billion kwh of renewable energy.

Description of product(s) or service(s)
Current and emerging broadband-enabled solutions such as Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G/edge computing solutions can help businesses make better decisions, improve efficiencies, save money, reduce GHG emissions and drive new revenue – all while solving tough operational problems. These “Smart Climate Solutions" can help customers reduce emissions through efficiency and through new product development:
Efficiency: IoT delivers near-real-time insights and analytics to many aspects of business, helping them make data-driven decisions that streamline processes, lower operating costs and drive value. By adding 5G, AI, video analytics, augmented reality or other technologies, opportunities to drive efficiency and emissions reductions can expand even further. Connectivity can also help support operational efficiency and emissions reduction by enabling equipment performance insights, helping customers optimize maintenance and reduce use of electricity, fuel, water and raw materials.
Product Development: Many customers are looking for ways integrate connectivity into the next generation of products and services, unlocking the potential to drive emissions reduction and grow new revenue. Connectivity can enable product enhancements such as continuous monitoring that enables resources efficiency, a transition to renewable/smart energy and continuous data-enabled business models that support low emissions innovation. https://www.business.att.com/products/business-sustainability.html

Life cycle stage(s) covered for the low-carbon product(s) or services(s)
Use stage
Functional unit used
The functional unit used to determine the emissions reduction impact depends on the use case. In many cases, it’s the number of connected devices, but in some cases it’s another unit such as building or vehicle. A complete list is available on our methodology document: https://about.att.com/content/dam/csr/2019/environment/Combined_10x_%20ATT%20Gigaton%20Methodology%20FINAL%20August%202021.pdf
Reference product/service or baseline scenario used
The baseline scenario for each impact analysis depends on the use case. In general, the baseline scenario is measured before the connectivity solution is implemented, establishing the “before connectivity” state. Then, the performance is measured “after connectivity,” when a connectivity solution has been added. The full list of use cases is available here: https://about.att.com/content/dam/csr/2019/environment/Combined_10x_%20ATT%20Gigaton%20Methodology%20FINAL%20August%202021.pdf

Change in renewable energy consumption	
164753
Decreased
2.97
Additional renewable energy certificates (RECs) retired resulted in a decrease of 164,753 MT CO2e. Compared to total Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2021, this comprises 2.97% of the overall change in emissions. This figure compares the relative impact in Market A + B for 2022 (1,105,983 MTCO2e) versus 2022 total renewable energy kWh (2,797,982,713 kWh), and then multiplies that impact by the incremental renewable energy kWh (416,801,603 kWh), such that (1,105,983 / 2,797,982,713)*416,801,603 = 164,753 mt CO2e (2.97% decrease).

% of supplier-related Scope 3 emissions as reported in C6.5
Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
We focus on this group of suppliers because they represent over 80% of our spend, in line with our public goal to, “by 2025, lead our supply chain to improve its social and environmental impacts by integrating sustainability performance metrics into our sourcing decisions for 80% of our spend.” By focusing on this group of large suppliers, we can maximize our impact and address the largest sources of Scope 3 emissions. Working with the CDP Supply Chain program, AT&T annually reaches out to approximately 30 suppliers. Through our engagement with CDP Supply Chain, we collect climate change and emissions information from our suppliers.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Working with the CDP Supply Chain program, AT&T annually reaches out to approximately 300 suppliers, representing over 80% of AT&T Communications spend. We focus on our top 80% of spend as a way to enable our leadership in supplier engagement and track progress toward our public supply chain goals. AT&T continues to make progress with efforts including: incorporation of sustainability clauses into agreements and RFPs, training our sourcing managers on the principles of sustainability, and providing updates to sourcing managers on supplier sustainability performance. AT&T will continue to expand incorporation of sustainability-oriented standards and analyses into sourcing decisions.

We measure success in our supplier engagement via increases in the percent of suppliers providing reliable emissions data. A successful program would see high numbers of suppliers requested to respond to the CDP questionnaire tracking emissions (80%+) as we know that this is the first step to reducing emissions. In 2022, suppliers representing 73% of spend reported that they track GHG emissions, an increase from 65% in 2021, which represents 97% of suppliers AT&T requested to complete the CDP questionnaire in 2022. 61% have specific GHG goals, representing 81% of requested suppliers.
Comment
AT&T supplier emissions data collection does not partition emission data by type of supplier engagement. We are, therefore, opting to provide the % total procurement spend in lieu of the % of supplier-related Scope 3 emissions.

In 2022, AT&T suppliers utilized the CDP Supply Chain Questionnaire and the TIA Sustainability Assessor metrics to measure and report their GHG emissions and sustainability progress. This provides our company and the other participating companies the necessary means to benchmark supplier emissions and work with suppliers on making improvements. We focus on this group of suppliers because they represent over 80% of our spend, in line with our public goal to, “by 2025, lead our supply chain to improve its social and environmental impacts by integrating sustainability performance metrics into our sourcing decisions for 80% of our spend.” By focusing on this group of large suppliers, can maximize our impact and address the largest sources of Scope 3 emissions. We recognize suppliers based on their score on the CDP Supply Chain Questionnaire, whether they measure and report their emissions, whether they have a science-based target for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reduction and outstanding performance on the TIA Sustainability Assessor aligning on TL 9000 quality standards across 10 areas of sustainability.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
AT&T annually reaches out to approximately 300 of our suppliers, representing over 80% of AT&T Communications spend. In alignment with our 2025 goal of “leading our supply chain to improve its social and environmental impacts by integrating sustainability metrics into our sourcing decisions,” we are focusing on standardized industry metrics. Through our work with CDP Supply Chain, the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) and TIA-QuEST Forum, we work to move our suppliers along an industry roadmap to continuously improve measurements benchmarking and results in sustainable supplier performance. We measure success in our supplier engagement through our suppliers setting their own emissions reduction goals. Our Scope 3 SBT is to have 50% of our spend be with suppliers with their own Scope 1 and 2 science-based targets. In 2022, we achieved this goal two years ahead of schedule with 53% of our spend in 2022 being with suppliers with at least Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reduction targets. AT&T’s support of our suppliers in setting emissions reduction targets and rewarding these efforts reduces the emissions impacts in our supply chain.

Impact of engagement, including measures of success
In 2022, AT&T held trainings for approximately 200 sourcing managers to improve their understanding of climate change and the importance of reducing their environmental impact. Enhancing our sourcing managers’ understanding will enable them to better work with suppliers to support AT&T’s ESG goals and their own ESG journeys, and we plan to offer the training again in 2023. We also produced and online training for suppliers to teach companies about calculating emissions and setting targets to reduce their emissions which was rolled out for the 2023 reporting period for all suppliers requested to complete the CDP Questionnaire. In our first year of utilizing the training, we hope to have at least one representative from 15 companies complete the training and provide feedback on their learning and suggestions to improve the training going forward.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
Through the Connected Climate Initiative, we are focused on delivering connectivity-driven solutions to help our AT&T Business customers reduce emissions. We have identified 9 key Impact Areas where AT&T connectivity can play a fundamental role in reducing emissions, including Modern Workplace, Transportation, Healthcare, Smart Cities and Buildings, Industrial, Energy, Consumer/Retail, Food, Beverage and Agriculture, and Reseller. AT&T Business customers represent 29% of annual revenue. We calculated this based on our 2022 Business Solutions revenue of approximately $35 billion. $35 billion is 29% of AT&T’s 2022 annual revenue of $120.7 billion.

We engage our customers in two ways. The first way is by introducing the idea of Smart Climate Solutions to customers who have set emissions reduction goals. As more customers set emissions reduction goals, we will position AT&T products and services that can help them achieve those goals. This can happen as part of a customer RFP response, executive briefing, or other customer meeting(s). Secondly, If the customer would like to expand collaboration beyond a traditional vendor relationship with us, we introduce them to AT&T’s Connected Climate Initiative (CCI). CCI represents a group of complementary technology companies, customers, academics and environmental NGOs that share the goal of reducing emissions at scale.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We measure success in three ways:
1. Customer engagement: We leverage internal systems to monitor customer engagement to see what types of solutions are of highest value.
2. Revenue: We also track revenue associated with Smart Climate Solutions. We are still in early stages of automating the tracking for both these metrics, but our long-term vision is to use these metrics to guide our path forward to maximize customer value and emissions reduction.
3. Emissions: We track AT&T-enabled customers emissions reduction metric via a methodology we developed in collaboration with BSR and the Carbon Trust. We measure our progress against our Gigaton goal by calculating the cumulative impact of emissions reduction from 2018, when we first calculated our emissions reduction enablement, until 2035. When we set this goal, we established a directional pathway to achieving it. We consider our progress to be a success if we have met at least 100% of the annual trajectory as defined by the pathway. At the end of 2022, we calculated cumulative AT&T-enabled customer emissions reductions of 149.2 million metric tons of CO2e – 15% toward our goal, in our first five years.

AT&T assesses how regulations, developments in technology, and market or reputational factors could affect our company. An increase in the cost of GHG emissions, such as through an imposed fuel or carbon tax or other pricing mechanism, may drive up the cost of fossil fuel-based energy. AT&T relies in part on fossil fuel-based energy to power our network and fleet. We also purchase a significant amount of electricity to power our operations. While we are working to increase the amount of renewable electricity in our portfolio, we still rely on the grid and non-renewable sources to ensure our energy supply. Any policy that increases the cost of GHG emissions and/or a policy that may drive up the cost of fossil fuel-based energy or power has the potential to increase our operating costs.

The Global eSustainability Initiative (GeSI) fosters open cooperation across international boundaries and the promotion of technologies that foster sustainable development. GeSI brings together leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies — including telecommunications service providers and manufacturers as well as industry associations — and nongovernmental organizations committed to achieving sustainability objectives through innovative technology. Through our participation in the GeSI organization, AT&T is represented in projects and activities centered in the three primary focus areas of GeSI: Climate Change (i.e., climate mitigations, energy efficiency, Science Based Targets), Supply Chain (i.e., responsible supply chains, conflict minerals) and Human Rights.

In 2015, Accenture conducted a study (SMARTer 2030) on behalf of the Global eSustainability Initiative (GeSI) and its member companies, including AT&T. The SMARTer 2030 report showed that the ICT industry can enable a low-carbon society and help respond to the climate change challenge by 2030. ICT-enabled solutions offer the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 9.7 times the amount of carbon emitted.

BRT’s Statement on Climate Change: “Because the consequences of global warming for society and ecosystems are potentially serious and far-reaching, steps to address the risks of such warming are prudent even now, while the science continues to evolve. The BRT supports collective actions that will lead to the reduction of GHG emissions on a global basis with the goal of slowing increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere and ultimately stabilizing them at levels that will address the risks of climate change. These actions need to be coordinated with efforts to address other urgent world priorities, such as reducing poverty, improving public health, reducing environmental degradation and raising living standards. Reliable and affordable world supplies of energy are essential for meeting these challenges. Although BRT supports actions to address global warming, our members have a range of views and preferences about the policy tools that will best achieve that objective...BRT supports an open and constructive dialogue about the principles that should shape climate policy and the pros and cons of various options.”
AT&T recognizes that climate change is happening, that GHG emissions are contributing to it, and that transitioning to a more resource efficient world will be a primary determinant of success in the 21st century global economy. We also believe that our technology is central to the success of this emerging global economy. We are committed to helping our customers retain their competitive edge in the global marketplace by leveraging our broadband network and services to create more economic value while reducing their energy consumption and emissions. We are also deeply committed to ongoing research, development and innovation that will introduce future products and services to help our customers live their lives and run their businesses more sustainably. At the same time, we must continually strive to reduce our own energy intensity and GHG emissions in all of our operations. As demand for our products and services increases, the amount of energy needed to power our network will also increase. Despite this challenge, we are committed to operating in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner through energy and water conservation and by focusing our efforts where they will have the most impact. We are also committed to working with our suppliers to limit environmental impacts and GHG emissions in our supply chain.

According to the U.S. Chamber’s website: “The climate is changing and humans are contributing to these changes. We believe that there is much common ground on which all sides of this discussion could come together to address climate change with policies that are practical, flexible, predictable and durable. We believe in a policy approach that acknowledges the costs of action and inaction and the competitiveness of the U.S. economy.”

AT&T recognizes the importance of transitioning to a world that is more resource efficient. We believe that the ability to increase resource efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be a primary determinant of success in the 21st century world economy. We also believe that technology is an important component of this transition.

AT&T’s SVP of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and ESG, who is also our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), is deeply involved in major climate-related strategy decisions, such as the planning and execution of projects, including our collaboration with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in 2020 and the Arbor Day Foundation in 2021, both of which have biodiversity impacts. The CSO also oversees ESG goal setting, such as our emissions and waste goals, which have biodiversity impacts.

The Governance and Policy Committee (GPC) of our Board has the highest level of responsibility for climate change-related activities within AT&T. The GPC has four members and meets four times/year. Our CSO is present at each GPC meeting to discuss climate-related issues as they relate to AT&T’s overall strategy, which has biodiversity impacts. The GPC provides input/guidance in the development of our strategy, as well as our programmatic and managerial approach. Our CSO also meets intermittently with individual members of the GPC to discuss sustainability-related topics of interest to the individual committee member.

The GPC’s charter outlines the Committee’s responsibilities related to public policy and specifically cites its authority over corporate policies and practices in furtherance of our CSR activities, including environmental policies. Programmatic operations for climate change-related activities fall under CSR at AT&T, therefore the GPC is ultimately responsible for biodiversity related topics, such as our climate change strategy.
